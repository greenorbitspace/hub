Guidelines and process for use of Publicity Waiver and Release agreements

## Is a Publicity Waiver and Release agreement required?

Subject to the exceptions listed below, a Release is required when:

- The name, image, likeness and appearance, voice, or professional biographical information (the “Likeness”) of any team member, former team member, or non-team member is used in external materials such that the individual is identifiable.

- Photography or videography by or on behalf of GitLab will take place at an internal or external event, such as a conference.

A Release is not required when:

- Using a current team member’s name, job title, or photo taken from the Meet Our Team page in external materials. This does not include the use of a former team member’s photo taken from that page.

- Using screenshots of GitLab.com which include a team member’s public GitLab profile information, including their name, GitLab username, and avatar.

- Streaming or publishing AMAs, and Group Conversations containing the Likeness of team members publicly to GitLab Unfiltered.

## Release templates

If a Release is required, the circumstances dictate which Release templates should be used:

- If you’re organising an event at which photography or videography by or on behalf of GitLab will be captured, use the Event Photography and Videography Likeness Release.

- For all other circumstances, refer to the diagram below to determine which Release template to use.

## Team Member Waiver and Release

For Team Members, if the materials will not be used in outbound advertising materials, use the Team Member Waiver and Release. If the materials will be used in paid outbound advertising, use the General Waiver and Release instead.

Each team member need only sign the Team Member Waiver and Release once.

## General Waiver and Release

For all non-Team Members, use the General Waiver and Release template. For Team Members, if the materials will be used in paid outbound advertising, use the General Waiver and Release Template.

<!-- Unsupported block type: toggle -->

## Event Photography and Videography Likeness Release

When capturing photos or video at events, don’t capture attendee name badges, or blur them where they appear.

For internal and external events at which photography or videography by or on behalf of GitLab will be captured, include the Event Photography and Videography Likeness Release Registration form language as a provision in the event registration terms and conditions, ensuring you have first completed the yellow-highlighted fields.

In addition, place Notice of Photography and Filming posters throughout the event space, or at the GitLab booth as appropriate, to notify attendees that photography and filming are taking place.
