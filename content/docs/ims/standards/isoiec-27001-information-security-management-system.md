Annex A Information security controls

Overview Of Annex A Controls

Annex A is divided into four categories of controls, each addressing a specific aspect of information security: organisational, people, physical and technological. ISO 27001 provides significant flexibility, enabling businesses to implement controls based on their unique risks and requirements. However, any exclusions must be justified to ensure the ISMS remains robust and compliant.

One key policy within Annex A is the Clear Desk Policy. This policy requires employees to ensure that sensitive information is safe, including all paper documents and devices containing confidential data. It also ensures that no information is left unattended in an unsecured environment. This policy directly impacts all physical security, so it can’t be overstated. Implementing the Clear Desk Policy reduces the risk of unauthorised access to sensitive information, ensuring that data is protected even when employees are away from their desks.

Statement of Applicability : What It Is & Why It Matters

The statement lists which controls from Annex A are being applied, the rationale for applying or excluding specific controls, and the status of their implementation. Making it a dynamic part of the ISMS, this document is reviewed periodically to ensure it remains up to date with changing threats and evolving security needs.

One of the key purposes of the SoA is to serve as evidence of compliance during audits. Auditors will examine the statement to verify that the organisation has appropriately selected controls based on its risk assessment and context. It also ensures that no controls are omitted without a valid reason. The SoA helps provide a structured, consistent approach to assessing and documenting the security measures in place.

Having a clear and well-maintained ISO 27001 Statement of Applicability not only ensures compliance with the standard but also reinforces the corporation’s commitment to data protection and security.

How to Create and Maintain an Effective SoA Document

First, a thorough risk assessment must be conducted. This will identify the security threats, vulnerabilities and risks. Based on these findings, the relevant controls from Annex A of this rule’s standard are selected.

Some controls may be deemed unnecessary for certain organisations, while others may require additional focus. For each control, the SoA should include a description of the control, its status (whether implemented or in progress), and an explanation of why it was selected. If a control is excluded, the document should justify why it is not relevant to the organisation’s risks or operational environment.

Additionally, the SoA should outline the ownership of each control. This helps ensure accountability and clarifies who within the company is responsible for managing and maintaining each security measure.

Regular updates are necessary as the organisation’s context and risk landscape evolve. As the business environment changes, new risks may emerge, and existing controls may need to be reviewed, refined or replaced. A review process should be established with periodic audits to check whether the controls are still aligned with goals and objectives. If any gaps are identified, corrective actions should be taken to address them.

Another important aspect to consider is the involvement of relevant stakeholders. The statement of applicability should not be a document created solely by the security team or compliance officers. This collaborative approach ensures that the SoA accurately reflects the corporation’s broader security strategy.

Top management, led by the Director, demonstrates visible and sustained commitment to information security by:
Integrating ISMS objectives with organisational goals, including sustainability, digital ethics, and operational excellence.
Providing clear direction and oversight for the establishment, implementation, and continual improvement of the ISMS.
Allocating the necessary financial, technical, and human resources to support security controls, awareness training, tooling, and incident response.
Endorsing key policies and procedures that guide secure behaviour across the organisation.
Ensuring accountability by embedding information security responsibilities into performance evaluations and decision-making structures.
Championing a "security-first" culture from onboarding to offboarding, across all departments and external partnerships.

Senior leadership receives regular reports on ISMS effectiveness, audit results, incidents, and improvement initiatives through structured dashboards and management reviews.
