### 3.1 The Social Responsibility of Organisations: Historical Background

The concept of social responsibility has evolved significantly over time. Traditionally, organisations were seen primarily as entities focused on maximising profits for shareholders. However, over the decades, the role of organisations in society has transformed, especially in light of growing concerns over environmental degradation, human rights, economic inequality, and social justice.

Social responsibility (SR) became a prominent consideration for businesses in the 20th century, primarily driven by increased public awareness of issues such as pollution, worker exploitation, and corporate governance scandals. The post-World War II era saw the emergence of corporations considering their impact on local communities, employees, and the environment, alongside their economic performance.

In the 1970s and 1980s, social responsibility became institutionalised through frameworks, policies, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) advocating for a more ethical approach to business. These organisations emphasised that businesses should not only seek profits but also contribute positively to the societies and ecosystems they operate in.

The introduction of environmental and social reporting in the 1990s, alongside corporate codes of conduct, created a platform for businesses to take action on social responsibility. The recognition of the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) grew, particularly among large multinational corporations. Today, social responsibility is seen as an integral part of good governance and sustainable business practice.

For Green Orbit Digital, social responsibility is fundamental to our mission. We view our role in society as not just achieving business success but also contributing to a more sustainable, fair, and equitable world. Our approach includes active efforts to promote environmental sustainability, human rights, ethical governance, and social engagement.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 3.2 Recent Trends in Social Responsibility

In recent years, the understanding and practice of social responsibility have significantly shifted. Key trends include:

1. Increased Focus on Sustainability: There is a growing recognition of the need for businesses to contribute positively to environmental sustainability. This includes reducing carbon footprints, conserving natural resources, and addressing climate change. Organisations are increasingly expected to implement robust sustainability strategies as part of their broader corporate responsibility initiatives.

1. Human Rights and Ethical Labour Practices: Organisations are becoming more conscious of their impact on human rights. In particular, there is increasing attention to supply chain transparency and the treatment of workers in global operations. Many businesses are now required to ensure that their operations respect human rights, avoid child labour, and provide fair wages and working conditions.

1. Community Engagement and Impact: Businesses are recognising the importance of contributing to the communities in which they operate. This includes everything from creating jobs and supporting local economies to contributing to educational and health programmes.

1. Corporate Transparency and Accountability: There is a growing demand for companies to be transparent about their social, environmental, and governance (ESG) practices. This has led to the rise of ESG reporting standards, where businesses publicly disclose their activities and progress in these areas.

1. Consumer Expectations: Consumers are increasingly making purchasing decisions based on the ethical behaviour of the brands they support. There is a clear preference for brands that demonstrate a commitment to social and environmental causes, which has prompted many companies to adapt their business models to reflect these values.

At Green Orbit Digital, we align with these trends by adopting sustainability-focused practices in all aspects of our operations. We promote eco-conscious marketing strategies, advocate for transparent and responsible space technologies, and support ethical supply chains that adhere to the highest standards of human rights and environmental stewardship.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 3.3 Characteristics of Social Responsibility

Social responsibility is not a one-size-fits-all concept; it is dynamic and varies according to an organisation’s size, sector, location, and other factors. However, there are several key characteristics that define socially responsible organisations:

1. Ethical Decision-Making: Organisations that demonstrate social responsibility take care to ensure that their decisions align with ethical principles. This includes fairness, integrity, respect for human dignity, and honesty.

1. Accountability: A responsible organisation is accountable for its actions and their impacts on society and the environment. It is open about its practices, transparent in reporting, and responsive to stakeholders’ concerns.

1. Commitment to Sustainable Development: Socially responsible businesses integrate sustainable practices into their operations and supply chains. They consider not only the economic viability of their activities but also their environmental and social impact.

1. Respect for Human Rights: Respecting human rights is a cornerstone of social responsibility. This involves ensuring that the organisation’s operations do not contribute to human rights abuses, such as exploitation, discrimination, or unsafe working conditions.

1. Engagement with Stakeholders: Social responsibility requires businesses to engage with stakeholders—including employees, customers, suppliers, and communities—to understand their needs and address any concerns or issues that arise.

1. Contributions to the Community: A responsible business actively contributes to the well-being of the communities it operates in. This might include economic support, social investments, or environmental conservation initiatives.

At Green Orbit Digital, we prioritise these characteristics by ensuring that our business practices are ethically grounded, transparent, and aligned with our commitment to sustainability. Through policies such as our CSR Framework, Carbon Management Plan, and active engagement with stakeholders, we integrate these principles into everything we do.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 3.4 The State and Social Responsibility

Governments and international bodies play a crucial role in shaping the expectations for social responsibility. They set regulations and guidelines to ensure that businesses adhere to the social, ethical, and environmental standards necessary to safeguard public interests. For example, laws related to environmental protection, anti-corruption, fair labour practices, and consumer protection are critical to creating a legal framework within which businesses must operate.

Governments also play a role in incentivising responsible behaviour. This may include offering tax breaks, subsidies, or recognition for businesses that demonstrate a commitment to social responsibility, while also penalising those that engage in harmful practices.

At Green Orbit Digital, we ensure that we comply with relevant regulations and contribute to creating a positive legal environment. For instance, our ISO 14001 accreditation helps us manage our environmental impacts effectively. Additionally, we strive to comply with international frameworks such as the UN Global Compact and align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Furthermore, we are actively involved in shaping the future of space sustainability by collaborating with relevant bodies to ensure that space activities are governed in ways that prioritise environmental protection and equitable social development.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

Conclusion

The concept of social responsibility has evolved into a broad, multifaceted framework that encompasses environmental sustainability, human rights, ethical governance, and community engagement. At Green Orbit Digital, we recognise the importance of these issues and incorporate them into our governance model. We are committed to integrating social responsibility into every aspect of our business, ensuring that our operations contribute positively to society, the environment, and the economy.

# 6 Guidance on social responsibility core subjects

## 6.1 General

## 6.2 Organisational governance

6.2.1 Overview of organizational governance 6.2.1.1 Organizations and organizational governance Organizational governance is the system by which an organization makes and implements decisions in pursuit of its objectives. Organizational governance can comprise both formal governance mechanisms based on defined structures and processes and informal mechanisms that emerge in connection with the organization's culture and values, often influenced by the persons who are leading the organization. Organizational governance is a core function of every kind of organization as it is the framework for decision making within the organization. Governance systems vary, depending on the size and type of organization and the environmental, economic, political, cultural and social context in which it operates. These systems are directed by a person or group of persons (owners, members, constituents or others) having the authority and responsibility for pursuing the organization's objectives. 6.2.1.2 Organizational governance and social responsibility Organizational governance is the most crucial factor in enabling an organization to take responsibility for the impacts of its decisions and activities and to integrate social responsibility throughout the organization and its relationships. Organizational governance in the context of social responsibility has the special characteristic of being both a core subject on which organizations should act and a means of increasing the organization's ability to behave in a socially responsible manner with regard to the other core subjects. 

This special characteristic arises from the fact that an organization aiming to be socially responsible should have an organizational governance system enabling the organization to provide oversight and to put into practice the principles of social responsibility mentioned in Clause 4. 6.2.2 Principles and considerations Effective governance should be based on incorporating the principles of social responsibility (see Clause 4) into decision making and implementation. These principles are accountability, transparency, ethical behaviour, respect for stakeholder interests, respect for the rule of law, respect for international norms of behaviour and respect for human rights (see Clause 4). In addition to these principles, an organization should consider the practices, the core subjects and the issues of social responsibility when it establishes and reviews its governance system. Further guidance on integrating social responsibility throughout the organization is provided in Clause 7. Leadership is also critical to effective organizational governance. This is true not only for decision making but also for employee motivation to practice social responsibility and to integrate social responsibility into organizational culture. Due diligence can be a useful approach for an organization in addressing the issues of social responsibility. For further guidance, see 7.3.1. 

6.2.3 Decision-making processes and structures 6.2.3.1 Description of the issue Decision-making processes and structures conducive to social responsibility are those that promote the use of the principles and practices described in Clauses 4 and 5. Every organization has decision-making processes and structures. In some cases, these are formal, sophisticated and even subject to laws and regulations; in other cases they are informal, rooted in its organizational culture and values. All organizations should put in place processes, systems, structures, or other mechanisms that make it possible to apply the principles and practices of social responsibility [126][159]. 6.2.3.2 Related actions and expectations An organization's decision-making processes and structures should enable it to: ⎯ develop strategies, objectives, and targets that reflect its commitment to social responsibility; ⎯ d.

You want it phrased properly for an ISO manual — so formal, structured, detailed language, as if it could be inserted into a full ISO 26000-aligned CSR/Sustainability Manual.

This will take some time because it needs care to meet the tone and format expected in ISO documentation, but here’s how I’ll structure it:

- Chapter Heading (e.g., "6.3 Human Rights")

- Core Subject Overview (brief)

- Issue Title (e.g., "6.3.3 Due Diligence")

- Green Orbit Digital’s Approach (detailed explanation)

- Policies, Procedures, and Initiatives (specific examples and naming real documents or frameworks where applicable)

# Chapter 7: Guidance on Integrating Social Responsibility Throughout an Organization

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 7.1 General

Integrating social responsibility (SR) throughout an organisation is an essential step towards fostering a positive impact on society, the environment, and the economy. To ensure that an organisation effectively incorporates SR into its strategy and operations, it is necessary to create structures, processes, and practices that support this goal across all levels and functions. This chapter provides guidance on how organisations can integrate social responsibility effectively, enhancing not only their internal practices but also their external relationships with stakeholders.

Social responsibility should not be a mere add-on to a company’s activities but rather a core element of the organisation’s overall purpose and strategy. From top management down to everyday operations, social responsibility should be embedded in decision-making, risk management, policy formulation, and stakeholder engagement. Organisations that successfully integrate SR not only meet regulatory requirements and ethical expectations but also differentiate themselves as leaders in sustainability, innovation, and governance.

### 7.2 The Relationship of an Organization's Characteristics to Social Responsibility

The characteristics of an organisation—such as its size, sector, geographical location, and organisational culture—are key determinants in how social responsibility is integrated. While the underlying principles of SR remain consistent across different organisations, the methods and strategies for integration will vary depending on these characteristics.

- Size of the Organisation: Larger organisations often have more formalised processes for integrating SR due to their scale, resources, and public visibility. For smaller organisations, SR may require more flexible, cost-effective strategies and grassroots efforts, although the commitment to SR principles remains the same.

- Sector of Activity: The specific industry in which an organisation operates influences the key areas of social responsibility that require attention. For example, a tech company may focus on data privacy, consumer rights, and ethical labour practices, while a manufacturing firm might prioritise environmental impact, resource use, and worker safety.

- Geographical Location: Organisations in different regions may face varying regulatory, economic, and cultural expectations related to SR. These differences require tailored approaches to ensure that the organisation adheres to local laws and responds to the unique needs and concerns of local stakeholders.

- Organisational Culture: An organisation’s values, mission, and overall approach to governance significantly shape how SR is integrated. A company with a culture of innovation and transparency will find it easier to integrate social responsibility through systems that encourage continuous improvement and stakeholder engagement.

At Green Orbit Digital, we take a holistic approach that integrates SR throughout the entire organisation, from aligning our mission and values with the principles of sustainability and ethical governance to fostering a collaborative, transparent, and forward-thinking work environment. By aligning our internal culture with our external goals, we ensure that social responsibility is embedded in every aspect of our operations.

### 7.3 Understanding the Social Responsibility of an Organization

To successfully integrate social responsibility into an organisation, it is essential that both leadership and employees fully understand what SR means for the organisation and how it can be practically applied. This understanding should be based on the core principles of SR, which include:

1. Ethical behaviour: Acting with integrity and fairness in all dealings with stakeholders.

1. Transparency: Open communication regarding the organisation’s practices, policies, and performance in relation to SR.

1. Accountability: Accepting responsibility for the social, environmental, and economic impacts of the organisation’s actions.

1. Respect for stakeholder interests: Engaging with and addressing the concerns of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and communities.

1. Sustainable development: Promoting practices that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

At Green Orbit Digital, our leadership team ensures that these principles are communicated across all departments, emphasising how SR is integral to our long-term success. We provide training, workshops, and internal resources to help all employees understand their role in achieving our sustainability goals and integrating SR into their daily work.

### 7.4 Practices for Integrating Social Responsibility Throughout an Organization

Integrating social responsibility requires practical steps that embed SR into the organisation's structure, culture, and operations. Key practices include:

1. Policy Development: Establishing clear policies that reflect the organisation’s commitment to SR. These policies should address key issues such as sustainability, ethical behaviour, human rights, and community engagement.

1. Management Systems: Implementing management systems that support the monitoring and reporting of SR activities. These systems should include tools to track progress, identify areas for improvement, and ensure alignment with broader strategic goals.

1. Stakeholder Engagement: Creating platforms for engaging stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, etc.) in SR efforts. This may include regular consultations, surveys, and feedback mechanisms that help understand stakeholder expectations and concerns.

1. Employee Involvement: Encouraging employees to participate in SR initiatives through volunteer programmes, awareness campaigns, or sustainable practice committees. Employees should feel empowered to contribute ideas and actions that align with the organisation's SR objectives.

1. Integration into Decision-Making: Ensuring that SR considerations are part of decision-making processes at every level of the organisation. This includes considering the social, environmental, and economic impacts of key business decisions, from procurement to product development to marketing.

At Green Orbit Digital, we have embedded SR into our strategic planning processes, ensuring that every department—from operations to marketing—has a clear understanding of how to contribute to sustainability. For instance, our Carbon Management Plan influences decisions regarding travel, energy use, and supplier relationships, while our Ethical Marketing Guidelines ensure we communicate responsibly with customers.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 7.5 Communication on Social Responsibility

Effective communication on social responsibility is crucial for fostering transparency, building trust with stakeholders, and promoting the organisation’s achievements in SR. Communication should include:

1. Internal Communication: Regularly communicating SR goals, progress, and challenges within the organisation. This can be done through internal newsletters, town hall meetings, and training sessions.

1. External Communication: Sharing the organisation’s SR initiatives with external stakeholders, including customers, investors, and the public. This can be achieved through sustainability reports, press releases, social media, and partnerships with advocacy groups.

1. Clear Reporting: Reporting SR outcomes in a clear, accessible manner that highlights the organisation’s achievements, challenges, and future goals. This should be part of annual reports or dedicated sustainability reports.

At Green Orbit Digital, we provide quarterly updates on our sustainability initiatives, including carbon reduction efforts, community engagement, and sustainable supply chain practices. We also maintain a transparent presence on our website, showcasing our achievements, partnerships, and commitments.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 7.6 Enhancing Credibility Regarding Social Responsibility

To enhance credibility regarding social responsibility, organisations must:

1. Third-Party Validation: Engage with external auditors or certifying bodies to validate the organisation’s SR claims. Certifications such as ISO 14001 for environmental management or B Corp certification provide assurance to stakeholders that the organisation adheres to internationally recognised standards.

1. Consistency and Accountability: Consistently delivering on SR promises and being accountable for any shortcomings. Organisations should be prepared to address any gaps between their SR commitments and actual performance.

1. Independent Audits: Conducting independent audits to assess the effectiveness of SR programmes and policies. This allows for continuous improvement and reassures stakeholders that SR is being taken seriously.

At Green Orbit Digital, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of credibility in our SR efforts. Our SBTi commitment, ISO certifications, and Ecologi membership help validate our claims and provide transparency around our carbon reduction initiatives. Additionally, we invite external audits of our policies and actions to ensure continual improvement.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 7.7 Reviewing and Improving an Organization's Actions and Practices Related to Social Responsibility

Continuous improvement is key to ensuring that SR practices evolve in line with changing expectations and challenges. Regular reviews of SR practices allow organisations to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for innovation. Key steps include:

1. Annual Reviews: Conducting annual reviews of the organisation’s SR performance to assess progress against goals, measure the impact of initiatives, and identify areas for improvement.

1. Feedback Mechanisms: Gathering feedback from internal and external stakeholders to understand the effectiveness of SR programmes and uncover new opportunities for improvement.

1. Adaptive Strategies: Adapting strategies based on the outcomes of reviews and feedback. This allows the organisation to respond dynamically to changing conditions and expectations.

At Green Orbit Digital, we undertake regular reviews of our Carbon Management Plan and CSR Framework to ensure that we are on track to meet our sustainability goals. We also conduct employee surveys and stakeholder consultations to gather feedback on our practices and make improvements.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### 7.8 Voluntary Initiatives for Social Responsibility

Many organisations voluntarily engage in initiatives that go beyond legal and regulatory requirements to further their commitment to social responsibility. These initiatives may include:

1. Industry Associations and Networks: Joining industry groups or networks that promote SR best practices and encourage collaboration across sectors.

1. Voluntary Standards and Certifications: Adopting voluntary standards, such as the UN Global Compact, ISO 26000, or Fair Trade, to demonstrate a commitment to responsible practices.

1. Philanthropic Initiatives: Engaging in social investment or charitable activities that contribute to the community or address pressing global challenges.

At Green Orbit Digital, we actively participate in voluntary initiatives like the Better Business Act, Design Declares, and SME Climate Hub to enhance our contribution to sustainability and foster collaboration with like-minded businesses. We also commit to philanthropic initiatives such as supporting environmental charities and sponsoring educational programmes focused on space sustainability.
