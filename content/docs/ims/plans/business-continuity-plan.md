# Essential Systems for Disaster Recovery

Based on the business impact analysis and recovery requirements, the following critical systems must be prioritized for disaster recovery preparation:

### 1. Knowledge Management Systems

- **Notion:** Primary knowledge base and documentation platform requiring regular exports and cloud backups

### 2. Communication Systems

- **Proton Mail:** Email communication system requiring backup strategy for emails and contacts

- **Ecosend:** Email marketing platform needing regular exports of campaign data and subscriber lists

### 3. Data Storage and Management

- **Proton Drive:** Secure file storage requiring redundant backups and encrypted storage solutions

### 4. Web Infrastructure

- **WordPress:** Website hosting platform requiring daily automated backups of database and files

- **Krystal Hosting:** Web hosting service needing regular verification of backup completion

### 5. Customer Relationship Management

- **HubSpot:** CRM system requiring periodic exports of contact data and pipeline information

Each of these systems requires specific backup strategies, recovery processes, and regular testing to ensure business continuity in case of disruption.
