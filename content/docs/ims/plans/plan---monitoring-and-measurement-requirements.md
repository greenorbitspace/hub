## 

Green Orbit Digital shall establish a comprehensive monitoring and measurement plan that includes:

- Monitoring and measuring key characteristics of operations that determine energy performance at planned intervals

- Evaluating actual versus expected energy consumption

- Defining and implementing an energy measurement plan appropriate to organizational size and complexity

- Maintaining records of significant energy uses identified in the energy review

- Tracking relevant variables related to significant energy uses

- Monitoring Energy Performance Indicators (EnPIs)

- Assessing effectiveness of action plans in achieving objectives and targets

## Implementation Requirements

The monitoring and measurement plan shall include:

- Regular calibration and maintenance of monitoring equipment to ensure data accuracy

- Investigation and response protocols for significant deviations in energy performance

- Documentation and record-keeping procedures for all monitoring activities

- Periodic review of measurement needs and updates to the plan as required

## Performance Evaluation

The organization shall:

- Maintain records of monitoring and measurement results

- Evaluate compliance with legal and other energy-related requirements at planned intervals

- Conduct regular internal audits to ensure effectiveness of the monitoring system

- Review results as part of the management review process
