# 1. Introduction

At Green Orbit Digital, we understand that employees may occasionally be unable to work due to illness or injury. This policy outlines our procedures for managing sickness absence and supporting employees in their return to work.

## 2. Notification of Sickness

Employees must notify their immediate supervisor or HR of any absence due to illness by 9:30 AM on each day of absence. Notification should be made via phone, email, or approved communication channels.

## 3. Short-Term Sickness

For absences up to 7 days, employees must complete a self-certification form documenting their illness. Enhanced sick pay of full salary is provided for up to 10 days per year, subject to proper notification and documentation.

## 4. Long-Term Sickness

For absences exceeding 7 days, a doctor's note is mandatory. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) will be provided according to current regulations. The company will maintain regular contact with employees on long-term sick leave to provide support and discuss return-to-work arrangements.

## 5. Return to Work Process

- Complete return-to-work documentation

- Attend a return-to-work meeting with supervisor or HR

- Discuss any necessary workplace adjustments or phased return arrangements

- Review workload and priorities

## 6. Support and Adjustments

The company will consider reasonable adjustments to support employees returning to work, which may include:

- Phased return to work

- Modified duties or working hours

- Workplace adaptations

- Additional training or support

## 7. Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure its effectiveness and compliance with current legislation and best practices.

# SICKNESS AND RETURN TO WORK

<!-- Unsupported block type: table -->

Implemented November 2024  | Version 2.0

While our aim at Wholegrain is for a happy, healthy team, we recognise there may be periods when you’re unwell and unable to work. This policy explains what we expect of you if you’re sick, suffering with an injury and/or unable to work and how we’ll support you when you are well enough to return.

This policy applies to all employees of Wholegrain Digital and aims to strike a balance between the needs of the business and the need for employees to take time to recover from sickness or injury.

Notifying Wholegrain of your sickness absence

You, or a family member in the event you are incapacitated, must notify your Line Manager directly of your absence from work, ideally by 9am GMT. We prefer notification via email, telephone or Slack where possible and appreciate you giving us as much warning as you can so we can cover your work. Please explain why you’re unable to work and how long you think the absence will last. Unless otherwise agreed, we’d like a telephone call or Slack message at the beginning of each day you’re unfit for work. You have every right to privacy and may state that the illness you are suffering from is confidential. In such cases, we may decide to organise for you to see an occupational health physician so that we can ensure that we are not doing anything that has contributed to your absence and can support you on your return to work.

If you know in advance that you’re going to be off for a scheduled appointment relating to your health (a planned operation for example), please give us as much warning as possible so we can arrange to reallocate your work. Scheduled appointments, such as consultations or other medical appointments, are not normally considered as sickness absence under this policy. Instead they should be organised where possible for outside of working hours or the time is made up in the event they can only occur during the working day. In the event that a scheduled appointment relates to an ongoing disability or pregnancy, then please let us know so that the time may be taken as disability or pregnancy related sickness absence.

In the event that you are an in-patient due to scheduled surgery, then so long as that surgery is not elective (i.e. not medically necessary, such as in the case of cosmetic enhancement surgery), then that period of absence may be taken as sickness absence.

Confidentiality

It goes without saying that all medical and other information relating to your health, or arising from this policy, will be kept confidential between the parties involved. Any and all information provided by you to Wholegrain about your health (including, but not limited to, forms and medical records) will be collected, held, and processed lawfully and in accordance with the Company’s ‘Data Protection Policy’. We recognise that such data is sensitive and will handle it accordingly and in accordance with your rights under the law.

Conduct during sick leave

If you’re off sick, we expect you to take care of yourself and do everything possible to speed your recovery. We don’t want you participating in activities that may aggravate your illness or injury, or be inconsistent with the reason(s) you are off sick in the first place. We expect you to refrain from undertaking Wholegrain work or indeed any other employment/voluntary activities for that matter, unless of course such has specifically been prescribed by your GP/medical advisor. If we need to contact you whilst you are absent due to sickness, then we need you to cooperate with all reasonable attempts to remain in contact with you.

Work arrangements when absent due to sickness

Please ensure that if you have a sickness absence, that you have updated your out of office, voicemail and calendar appointments. This is so that clients and colleagues are aware that you are unavailable for a period of time and who an alternative contact is. It is not necessary to state that you are unwell and unable to work in doing so.

Falling sick during the work day

If you fall ill or become injured during your working day, then please let us know and confirm whether or not you can continue to work to an acceptable standard. In most cases, we will accept your judgement as to whether or not you are well enough to continue/stop working. However, in the event that your illness or injury is a health and safety risk to you or others, then we may have to override your decision. In such cases two Managers will agree on such action before doing so. In the event you have an accident at work, please ensure you complete an ‘Accident, Injury or Near Miss Reporting Form.’

Falling sick prior to holiday leave

In the frustrating event that you fall ill or become injured prior to taking holiday leave then we are happy for you to postpone and re-arrange some, or all of your holiday leave (in accordance with our ‘Holiday Policy’), for when you are feeling much better. Please ensure that you still follow the above notification requirements whilst absent during this time and provide the necessary certification for this period as detailed in this policy.

Falling sick during holiday leave

If you fall ill or become injured whilst on holiday leave then provided you contact your Line Manager in accordance with the above notification requirements, then your holiday leave may be converted to sickness absence instead. Please ensure that you provide the necessary certification for this period as detailed in this policy. Any re-booked annual leave will be in accordance with our ‘Holiday Policy’.

Company sick pay (CSP)

Your entitlement to CSP is stipulated in your contract of employment. CSP is discretionary and is inclusive of statutory sick pay (SSP). CSP is calculated on your basic salary and is subject to deductions for tax and National Insurance.

If you don’t follow this policy, or there is a reason to doubt the validity of your absence, then we may temporarily withhold CSP until we have further information, or withdraw it. If your absence has been the result of your failure to follow company policy, or from outside employment, or through participation in dangerous sports or activities, then we may withdraw or withhold CSP until we are satisfied that it is fair to pay it.

Statutory sick pay (SSP)

SSP is a standard rate which is determined by the Government, normally each April. The first 3 days of SSP are unpaid and the maximum amount of SSP that can be received is 28 weeks. Qualifying days for SSP purposes for Wholegrain employees are Monday to Friday and SSP is subject to deductions for tax and National Insurance.

Pension contributions whilst on sick leave

If you are in the NEST pension scheme then contributions will continue as normal whilst you are receiving CSP. Pension contributions will also continue whilst in receipt of SSP only, albeit they will be based upon your reduced and actual earnings.

Certification

For absences of 7 calendar days or under, you will need to complete a ‘Sick Leave Self-Certification Form’ (available from The Granary) on your first day back at work.

If your absence is likely to extend 8 calendar days or more, then you are required to submit a medical certificate from your GP or hospital physician. A recognised medical certificate should be forwarded to your Line Manager on or before the 8th day of absence. In the event that you fall ill/become injured when outside of the UK, then we will accept a foreign medical certificate for the duration that you were due to be in that country.

Medical examinations

If you’ve been absent due to sickness for 4 weeks or more, or we are concerned about a pattern of sick leave or your health, safety or capability in relation to your duties, then we may need to obtain some medical advice in relation to you.

We would seek this information from either your GP or via an Occupational Health Physician/Advisor. Before doing so we would discuss the reasons for requesting this information with you. We’d also organise the appointment/request the report and cover the cost of doing so. Under the Access to Medical Report Act 1988 and/or General Medical Council rules, you would get the opportunity to view the medical information before it was sent to Wholegrain and you would be required to give your permission to the relevant medical practitioner for its release to us. In the event you did not want such information provided to us, then we would have to base any action or decision in relation to your sickness absence or sickness record, on the information already available to us at the time.

Returning to work after a sickness absence

Please let your Line Manager know when you are well enough to resume your duties, either the morning of, or the evening before, your return would be fine. Whilst we want you back to work as soon as possible, we don’t want you resuming your duties until you are fit and able to. If you are not sure then speak to your Line Manager about your concerns. You may also consider speaking to your GP, NHS 111 or obtaining medical advice from a pharmacist.

When you return to work, your Line Manager will conduct a ‘Return to Work Check-In’ with you. The purpose of this chat is to check you are ok to be back at work; agree any necessary actions required to facilitate your return to work; for you to make us aware of any concerns about being back at work and in relation to your health; and to update you with anything that has occurred in Wholegrain whilst you have been absent. Your Line Manager will also check that your absence has not reached any absence stages as detailed below and discuss next steps with you if they have.

Absence levels owing to sick absence

If you have had 3 or more sickness absences in a rolling 12-month period, then it is likely to trigger one of the below absence stages:

<!-- Unsupported block type: table -->

Sickness absence is measured within a rolling twelve-month period; therefore some periods of sickness absence will not be taken into account as they fall outside of the retrospective twelve-month period.

In the event that you reach one of the sickness absence stages, you will be asked to attend a ‘Sickness Capability Meeting’ to discuss the situation. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the reasons for the absences; identify any underlying causes for them; discuss with you the need for/benefit of an occupational health referral; explore what support can be offered to you to help improve your attendance; and set a review period for monitoring attendance for the next 12 months. You will also be advised of what sickness absence stage you are at and the consequences of further sickness absence in respect of the above sickness absence stages.

At each sickness absence stage the situation will be discussed with you and all facts will be considered carefully before confirming if you will be given a notice. Written notice of the meeting will be provided at least 72 hours in advance and if a notice is given as an outcome of this meeting, you will have the right to appeal against it.

Long term sickness absence

We sincerely hope this doesn’t happen but in the event that you are absent due to sickness for a period, or periods, totalling in excess of 26 working weeks in any twelve-month period, then your absence will be classed as being long term sick.

We will keep in regular contact with you during this time to see what support we can offer you as well as keep in you updated as to what’s happening in Wholegrain. We will arrange for you to have an appointment(s) with an Occupational Health Physician/Advisor to understand when you might return to work and if there would be any reasonable adjustments that we could put in place in order for you to do so. We will discuss their report with you and seek your opinion of the timescales for your return to work. Any home visits will be by prior agreement and only with your consent.

Unfortunately we are not able to keep a job open indefinitely due to the impact on the business and the team, therefore, if you are likely to be absent from work/your duties owing to sickness or injury for longer than 26 weeks, then there is a possibility that your contract of employment would be terminated due to ill-health. Before reaching this decision, we will ensure we have up to date medical information from you and your GP/Occupational Health and we have discussed with you the possibility of a likely return to work days and in what format (phased return/part-time/full-time/redeployment etc.). If after 26 weeks of absence all the medical reports state a return to work in the foreseeable future (approx.. 4-6 weeks) either in full or reduced capacity is unlikely, then a ‘Sickness Capability Meeting’ will be arranged whereby your contract of employment may be terminated.

In the event that you receive the terrible diagnosis of a terminal illness, then aside from wanting to help you in whatever way we can, we may decide not to terminate your contract due to ill-health but instead retain you on our payroll to allow any dependents of yours to take advantage of any death in service benefits that may be in force at the time.

Disabled employees

We recognise that talent comes in all shapes and sizes and that our employees may have disabilities, as defined under the Equality Act 2010, either visible or otherwise. We want to support all our employees and recognise that due to disability it is important to consider, and where possible, accommodate, any reasonable adjustments to things such as working hours, conditions, responsibilities, training, for example. In addition, that such change(s) may need to be on a permanent or temporary basis. In the event that you have a disability then please make your Line Manager aware in the first instance, so that we can start the discussion regarding the necessary support that you may require in order for you to conduct your role. We may need to obtain medical advice to ensure we are fully aware of any reasonable adjustments that relate to your disability, either now or in the near future. Will we discuss this with you prior to organising such.

In the event that your disability results in you having sickness absence, we may disregard those occasions for the purposes of evaluating whether a sickness absence stage has been reached. In addition, if you need to attend medical appointments in relation to your disability, then these may be classified as disability sickness absence, whether they have been scheduled or otherwise.

Pregnancy-related sickness absence

Pregnant employees who are absent from work due to pregnancy-related ill health are required to follow this policy. Any sickness absence by a pregnant employee for a pregnancy-related reason should not be taken into account by Line Managers when deciding if the need for action under this policy has been reached. Please also refer to our ‘Parent Leave Policy’ for further details in relation to maternity leave commencing early due to pregnancy related sickness absence.

Drugs and alcohol abuse

Drugs (illegal or otherwise), alcohol or substance dependency will be regarded as an illness if we have been notified of it prior to it being referenced as mitigation for misconduct. Support will be offered to you if the problem is disclosed and help is requested prior to it becoming a disciplinary issue.

a. Sickness Policy

Statement and Purpose of Policy

1. Green Orbit Digital (the Employer, we, our or us) recognises that you may not always be fit to attend work or may become ill or be injured at work and so this policy is designed to ensure that instances of sickness are dealt with consistently, fairly, and in a non-discriminatory way.

1. We must ensure that the reasons for sickness absence are understood in each case and, if necessary, investigated. We will adopt practical and reasonable measures to assist employees returning to work after sickness absence if we think they would be helpful.

1. This policy sets out our procedures for reporting and managing sickness absence, whether the absence is for several short illnesses or a long-term illness. All employees must abide by the terms and spirit of this policy.

1. This policy summarises your statutory rights. If there is a conflict between this policy and the statutory entitlements, this policy is amended, as necessary, to comply with legal requirements.

1. This is a statement of policy, which applies to employees only and does not form part of your contract of employment. We may amend this policy at any time, at our absolute discretion.

1. We process personal data when managing sickness absence and employees' right to sick pay in accordance with our Data Protection and Data Security Policy, contained within this Staff Handbook. In particular, we process personal data related to sickness in accordance with our policy on processing 'special categories of personal data' (which includes, but is not limited to, information about an individual's health). Data collected as part of this procedure is held securely and accessed by, and disclosed to, individuals only for the purposes of managing sickness absence and administering sick pay. Inappropriate access or disclosure of employee data constitutes a data breach and should be reported in accordance with the Data Protection and Data Security Policy immediately. It may also constitute a disciplinary offence, which will be dealt with under the Employer’s Disciplinary Procedure, contained within this Staff Handbook.

Disabilities

1. You should inform X if any medical condition affects your ability to do your job or if you are affected by a disability.

1. We will consider, at each stage of our sickness procedure, whether sickness absence is the result of a disability and whether reasonable adjustments will assist with a return to work.

Reporting Sickness Absence

1. If you become ill or are injured at work, you should contact X and fill in the accident book if appropriate. If you require basic first aid, you should contact X, otherwise you should leave work to go home or to receive medical treatment.

1. If you are ill or injured and cannot attend work you should telephone X or your line manager no later than 30 minutes before you normally start work, unless circumstances (e.g. an extreme emergency) do not allow for this. You should tell X or your line manager:

1. Managers should record all sickness absence they are notified of and arrange for any urgent work to be covered until the relevant employee's return.

1. Your line manager may contact you during your sickness absence to discuss your health, urgent work being covered in your absence, and to be advised, if possible, of your expected return date. This contact will be kept to a minimum to allow you to recover, but you should contact X if you wish to discuss your condition further.

1. For sickness absence of up to 7 days, you must complete a self-certification form, available from X. Where we are concerned about the reason for absence or short-term absence is frequent, we may require a medical certificate for sickness absences of less than 1 week. In such circumstances, we will cover the costs of this, if you provide your doctor's invoice. For an absence of more than 1 week, you must provide us with a ‘Statement of Fitness for Work’ or ‘Fit Note’ stating that you are not fit for work and the reason(s) why and provide this to X. Medical certificates must be provided for the whole time you are away.

1. If your doctor provides a certificate stating that you ‘may be fit for work’ you should inform X immediately. We will discuss any measures suggested by your doctor to help you return to work, but if suitable arrangements cannot be made, you will stay on sick leave and we will set a date to review your situation.

1. We may, at any time, require you to consent to a medical examination by a doctor nominated by us. You agree that any report produced after such examination may be disclosed to us and that we may discuss the contents of the report with the relevant doctor.

1. If it is suspected that you are claiming to be unwell whilst absent, but that you are indeed well, or you fail to follow the procedure set out in this policy for reporting sickness absence, your absence will be treated as an unauthorised absence and will be dealt with in accordance with the Employer’s Disciplinary Procedure.

Sick Pay

1. You may qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) at the rate set by the Government, if you satisfy the statutory requirements and provide us with medical certificates as stated in this policy. Qualifying days for SSP are Monday to Friday, or as stated in your employment contract. No payment is made for the first 3 consecutive days of sickness absence, but from the fourth day, SSP may be payable for up to 28 weeks. If you do not qualify or your SSP entitlement is coming to an end we will give you a form SSP1 telling you why.

1. After you have completed 6 months continuous service you will be entitled to receive your full salary and contractual benefits (inclusive of any SSP) during any sickness absence up to a maximum of 4 weeks in any year. A year runs from the same dates as our holiday year.

1. If sickness absence is or appears to be caused by a third party and damages are or may be recoverable, you must immediately tell X of that fact and of any claim, settlement or judgement made or awarded in connection with it. If we require you to do so, you must co-operate in any related legal proceedings and refund to us that part of any damages or compensation you recover that relates to lost earnings for the sickness absence we have paid you for.

1. Any employer and employee pension contributions will continue subject to the relevant scheme rules during any period of enhanced sick pay or SSP.

Returning to Work After Sickness Absence

1. If you have been on sick leave for more than 5 days we will arrange for you to have a return-to-work interview with X to confirm the details of your absence and to raise any concerns or questions. The contents of any certificate from your doctor stating you 'may be fit for work' will also be discussed at an informal return-to-work interview.

1. We are committed to helping employees return to work from long-term sickness absence. As part of our sickness absence meetings procedure we will, where appropriate and possible, support a return to work after long-term sickness by:

1. If you are unable to return to work in the longer term, we will consider whether you are entitled to any benefits under your contract and/or any insurance schemes we operate.

Sickness Absence Meetings Procedure

1. We will follow this procedure whenever we feel it is necessary, including where:

1. You will usually be given at least 2 days' written notice by X of a sickness absence meeting, setting out why the meeting is being called and the date, time, and place of the meeting. This notice will give you a reasonable opportunity to consider what will be discussed before the meeting takes place.

1. You may bring a companion with you to the meeting (a colleague or trade union representative unless we, at our absolute discretion, allow for you to bring someone else to assist in overcoming difficulties caused by a disability or a barrier to communication). You must supply X with the details of your companion at least 24 hours before the start of the meeting. Employees are allowed reasonable time off without loss of pay to act as a companion but are not obliged to do so. A companion may make representations, ask questions, and sum up your position, but will not be allowed to answer questions on your behalf. You may discuss relevant matters privately with your companion at any time during a meeting. These provisions also apply to final sickness absence meetings and appeal meetings for decisions related to sickness absence.

1. Failure to attend a meeting or at least to make all reasonable steps to attend a meeting may be treated as misconduct. A meeting may be adjourned if:

1. Decisions, reasons for the decisions, and your right of appeal will be confirmed in writing within 14 days of any meeting under this procedure (unless this is not practicable, in which case it will be provided as soon as is practicable).

Sickness Absence Meetings

1. This is a first formal opportunity to discuss reasons for absence, how long an absence is likely to last, the likelihood of recurring absence, whether we should refer you to a doctor, what (if anything) we could do to assist with your attendance at work, and when a further review should take place. You may be accompanied to this meeting by a companion.

1. Further meeting(s) may be required to discuss:

1. After warning you that you are at risk of dismissal, we may invite you to a final sickness procedure meeting. You may be accompanied at this meeting by a companion.

1. At a final sickness absence meeting, we may discuss the content of previous meetings and any changes since our last meeting under this procedure that could impact your return. We may discuss whether it is reasonable to expect you to return to work, the hours of work required, a reasonable timescale for this, and other relevant matters you would like to discuss. We may also discuss the possible termination of your employment at a final sickness absence meeting, which would normally be on full notice or payment in lieu of notice.

Appeals

1. You may appeal in writing against the outcome of any meeting during this procedure, setting out your reasons, to X within 7 days of the date on which you were sent the decision. You may bring a companion to an appeal meeting.

1. You will usually be given 1 week's written notice of an appeal meeting. If new matters are raised in an appeal more investigation may delay the meeting. If there is new information, you will be provided with a copy at least 24 hours before an appeal meeting so that you have a reasonable opportunity to consider it before the meeting.

1. Where practicable, an appeal meeting will be conducted by a more senior manager than the individual who conducted the sickness absence meeting.

1. Depending on the circumstances, an appeal meeting may be a complete rehearing of the matter or a review of the original decision.

1. The final decision will be confirmed in writing, usually within 1 week of the appeal meeting. There will be no further right of appeal.

1. The dismissal date will not be delayed whilst the outcome of an appeal is awaited. However, if the appeal is successful, the decision to dismiss will be overturned and there will be no loss of continuity or pay.
