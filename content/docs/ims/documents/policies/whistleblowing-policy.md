1. Introduction:
At Green Orbit Digital, we uphold the highest standards of ethics and integrity in all aspects of our operations. We recognize that whistleblowing plays a crucial role in identifying and addressing wrongdoing or unethical behavior within the company. This policy is designed to encourage employees and others associated with Green Orbit Digital to confidentially report concerns about illegal or severely unethical conduct.

2. Objectives of the Policy:
The objectives of this policy are to:

- Facilitate the investigation of reported concerns and take appropriate action to address them.

- Criminal activities

- Health and safety hazards

- Financial misconduct

4. Protection for Whistleblowers:

- Whistleblowers are protected under the law, including the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, which prohibits victimization or dismissal of employees who report concerns in good faith.

- Green Orbit Digital is committed to providing support and protection to whistleblowers, including protection from harassment or victimization.

- Any instances of harassment or victimization against whistleblowers will be treated as serious disciplinary offenses and will be dealt with accordingly.

5. Reporting Procedure:

- Concerns should be raised with the People and Office Manager or one of the Directors of Green Orbit Digital.

- Whistleblowers may report concerns via email, telephone, or in person.

- Whistleblowers should provide detailed information about the nature of their concerns, including relevant background information and any evidence available.

- Whistleblowers may choose to raise concerns anonymously, although doing so may limit the effectiveness of the investigation.

6. Handling of Concerns:

- Upon receiving a concern, Green Orbit Digital will conduct an initial assessment to determine the appropriate course of action.

- Investigations will be carried out promptly and impartially by management or designated personnel.

- Whistleblowers will be kept informed of the progress and outcome of the investigation to the extent possible, while maintaining confidentiality.

7. Support and Confidentiality:

- Whistleblowers will receive full support from the People and Office Manager and Directors throughout the reporting and investigation process.

- All concerns will be treated with the utmost confidentiality, and whistleblowers' identities will be protected to the fullest extent possible.

- Records of concerns, investigations, and outcomes will be maintained confidentially and securely by Green Orbit Digital.

8. Taking Matters Further:

- If whistleblowers are not satisfied with the outcome of the investigation, they may choose to escalate the matter externally to the police, trade union representatives, or legal authorities.

- This policy does not prevent whistleblowers from seeking their own legal advice if necessary.

9. Record Keeping:

- Green Orbit Digital will document and keep records of all concerns raised, investigations conducted, and outcomes reached.

- These records will be stored confidentially and will only be accessed when required for investigative or compliance purposes.

Conclusion:
Green Orbit Digital is committed to fostering a culture of transparency, integrity, and accountability. Through the implementation of this whistleblowing policy, we aim to create a safe and supportive environment for reporting concerns and addressing issues of wrongdoing or misconduct. We encourage all employees and stakeholders to speak up if they become aware of any actions that violate our values or principles, and we are committed to taking prompt and appropriate action to address such concerns.



# WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY

<!-- Unsupported block type: table -->

# 1. Policy Statement

Green Orbit Digital promotes a culture of openness and transparency in its interactions with managers, employees, and all stakeholders involved in its business and training activities. The organization recognizes the importance of effective and honest communication to address concerns about breaches or failures and ensure overall success.

This policy is designed to provide guidance to all those who work with or within the organisation who may from time to time feel that they need to raise certain issues relating to the organisation with someone in confidence.

Workers who in the public interest raise genuine concerns under this policy will not under any circumstances be subjected to any form of detriment or disadvantage as a result of having raised their concerns.

1.1 Objective:

This policy aims to empower and encourage staff to report concerns within Green Orbit Digital. It acknowledges workers' legal rights to make protected disclosures under relevant legislation, fostering a safe and transparent workplace culture.

1.2 Commitment to Prevention:

Green Orbit Digital is committed to preventing and addressing fraud, misconduct, and wrongdoing by promptly investigating and addressing reported concerns. Internal mechanisms are in place for reporting malpractice or illegal activities, with a commitment to consistent and fair treatment of all disclosures.

1.3 Training and Induction:

Regular refresher training is provided to all managers, ensuring they are equipped to handle raised concerns. New employees, supervisors, and managers undergo induction on the whistleblowing policy, emphasizing awareness of whistleblowing laws and the proper use of the policy.

1.4 Resources and Accessibility:

Adequate resources are allocated to support the policy's aims, and it is widely promoted. Copies are accessible in Green Orbit Digital's offices and through the staff intranet, ensuring widespread awareness.

1.5 Protection from Retaliation:

This policy assures staff protection from harassment or victimization for raising concerns. In case of dissatisfaction with the management response, staff are encouraged to escalate the matter further.

2. Definitions and Scope:

This policy applies to all staff, including temporary, casual, and agency staff, as well as volunteers, self-employed individuals, and contractors. Whistleblowing, as recognized by Green Orbit Digital, involves passing on information about wrongdoing at work when the whistleblower reasonably believes they are acting in the public interest.

Examples of wrongdoing include criminal offenses, breaches of legal obligations, miscarriages of justice, endangering health and safety, environmental damage, and deliberate concealment of information related to these issues.

2.2 Protection and Confidentiality:

Staff making protected disclosures have the right to protection from dismissal, detriment, or victimisation. Confidentiality is maintained throughout the process, and any confidentiality clauses in settlement agreements do not prevent disclosures in the public interest.

2.3 Reporting Other Concerns:

For concerns about employment that affect only the individual, the grievance or dignity at work policies are more appropriate.

1. ensure the staff member receives timely support to progress their concern

1. escalate to senior management any indications that the staff member is being subjected to detriment for raising their concern

5. How to Raise a Concern:

Staff are encouraged to raise concerns informally with their line manager or directly with designated officers. The policy provides guidance on raising concerns, seeking legal advice if necessary, and ensuring confidentiality.

5.1 Raising Concerns Anonymously:

While staff may disclose information anonymously, it is noted that anonymous whistleblowers may have limitations in receiving feedback or participating in the resolution process.

1. 

6. How Green Orbit Digital Will Respond:

Concerns raised under this policy are thoroughly, promptly, and confidentially investigated. The process involves acknowledging receipt, indicating how the matter will be handled, informing the staff of the investigation's progress, and providing timely feedback on outcomes.

6.1 Investigation and Data Protection:

Internal investigations are objective and evidence-based, processed in line with Green Orbit Digital's data protection policy. The investigation aims to identify and rectify issues, learning lessons to prevent recurrence.

1. 

7.3 This policy encourages members of staff to put their name to their concerns.  Concerns expressed anonymously are harder to follow up and have an effective outcome.

7.4If a member of staff makes an allegation in good faith, but the allegation is not confirmed by the investigation, no action will be taken against that member of staff. They will not be at risk of losing their job or suffering any form of reprisal as a result. Provided the member of staff is acting honestly, it does not matter if they are mistaken or if there is an innocent explanation for their concerns.

8. Reporting to External Bodies:

While the policy encourages internal reporting, staff dissatisfied with outcomes or uncomfortable raising concerns internally may report externally to prescribed persons or bodies listed by the UK government.

This policy is intended to provide a route by which members of staff can raise concerns internally.  However, if an employee is unhappy with the outcome of an investigation or if, for any reason they do not feel comfortable raising their concern internally, they are free to take the matter outside of the organisation to a prescribed person or body or to their Member of Parliament (MP).

1. 

9. More Information and Support:

Staff seeking additional information and support can access Protect, the UK's whistleblowing charity, for free expert and confidential advice. Government advice on whistleblowing and additional support through the employee assistance program is also available.

The law provides protection for workers who raise legitimate concerns about specified matters (whistleblowers). These are called "qualifying disclosures". A qualifying disclosure is one made in the public interest, or preserving the charitable focus of the organisation, by a worker who has a reasonable belief that one or more of the following is, or has been, or is likely to be committed:

- 

- 

- 

- 

- 

- 

a criminal offence;

a miscarriage of justice;

an act creating risk to health and safety;

an act causing damage to the environment;

a breach of any other legal obligation;

concealment of any of the above;

It is not necessary for the worker to have proof that such an act is being, has been, or is likely to

be, committed - a reasonable belief is sufficient. The worker has no responsibility for

investigating the matter, it is the organisation's responsibility to ensure that an investigation

takes place.

A worker who makes such a legitimate protected disclosure has the right not to be dismissed,

subjected to any other detriment, or victimised, because they have made a disclosure.

The legislation protecting individuals who make a protected disclosure applies not only to

workers but also to any person who undertakes to do or perform personally (or otherwise) any

work or service for the employer, regardless of the nature of the contractual relationship

between them.

Whistleblowing Policy

WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY

Ref: FP01 v5

This document is uncontrolled if printed

WRAP encourages workers to raise their concerns under this procedure in the first instance. If a

worker is not sure whether to raise a concern, they should discuss the issue with their line

manager or a member of the HR team.

This policy applies to all workers of WRAP. Other individuals performing functions in relation to WRAP, such as agency workers and contractors, are encouraged to use it.

It is important to WRAP that any fraud, misconduct or wrongdoing by workers of the

organisation is reported and properly dealt with. WRAP therefore encourages all individuals to

raise any concerns that they may have about the conduct of others in the business or the way in

which the business is run.

This policy sets out the way in which individuals may raise any concerns that they have and how

those concerns will be dealt with.

Any matter raised under this procedure will be investigated thoroughly, promptly and confidentially, and the outcome of the investigation reported back to the worker who raised the issue.

A worker who makes such a protected disclosure has the right not to be dismissed, subjected to

any other detriment, or victimised, because s/he has made a disclosure. This means that the

continued employment and opportunities for future promotion or training of the worker will not

be prejudiced because they have raised a legitimate concern. If a worker believes that s/he has

suffered any such treatment, s/he should inform the Commercial, Finance & Operations Director

(CFO) immediately. If the matter is not remedied, the worker should raise it formally using the

Grievance Procedure. Victimisation of a worker for raising a qualified disclosure will be a disciplinary offence and could

result in disciplinary action in accordance with the organisation’s disciplinary procedure.

“Protect” is a whistleblowing charity who provide confidential advice for individuals who have

witnessed wrongdoing in their workplace but are unsure how to raise their concerns. They

operate a confidential helpline 020 3117 2520 and advice can be found on their website: www.protect-advice.org.uk This policy is written in line with guidance from the Charity Commission, further information

Stage 1. Any disclosure should be made to the CFO in the first instance. If the disclosure relates

to the CFO, then the disclosure should be made to the CEO. If the disclosure implicates the

CEO, the disclosure should be made to the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee (contact

details at the end of the policy). The individual to whom the disclosure is made is designated as

the Investigation Sponsor.

Stage 2. The Investigation Sponsor will arrange an investigation into the matter (either by

investigating the matter personally or immediately passing the issue to an independent person

with the appropriate technical expertise to carry out an investigation). The investigation may

involve the worker and other individuals involved giving a written statement. Any investigation

If a worker reports a disclosure to WRAP, the need for confidentiality will be respected although any concern raised under this procedure will need to be properly documented.

WRAP believes that all workers should feel able to put their name to the allegations which they

raise, as concerns expressed anonymously are more difficult to investigate. If workers raise a

concern anonymously, depending upon the exact circumstances, it may nonetheless be possible

for their identity to be deduced. If, contrary to this policy, they then suffer reprisals, it may be

difficult to show that this was as a result of them raising a concern, i.e. it may not be possible to

protect unidentified people.

If a worker reports his / her concern to the media, in most cases the worker will lose his / her

whistleblowing law rights.

Procedure

If misconduct is discovered as a result of any investigation under this procedure the organisation's disciplinary procedure will be used, in addition to any appropriate external measures.

If an allegation is made maliciously, for personal gain or is deemed to be vexatious, appropriate

action, that could include disciplinary action, may be taken.

An instruction to cover up wrongdoing is itself a disciplinary offence. If told not to raise or pursue

any concern, even by a person in authority such as a manager, workers should not agree to

remain silent. They should report the matter to a member of the HR team. This procedure is for disclosures about matters other than a breach of a worker's own contract

of employment. If a worker is concerned that their own contract has been, or is likely to be,

broken, they should use the organisation's grievance procedure.

will be carried out in accordance with the principles set out above. The worker's statement will

be considered, and they will be asked to comment on any additional evidence obtained.

The outcome of the investigation, including a recommendation as to whether the matter

requires reporting to the appropriate government department or regulatory agency (see further

details below), will be submitted to the CEO. All whistleblowing disclosures will also be reported

to the Audit and Risk Committee for information. If the whistleblowing disclosure concerns the

CEO then the report will go to the Audit and Risk Committee only. If disciplinary action is required, the Investigation Sponsor will report the matter to the HR team

and start the disciplinary procedure. On conclusion of any investigation, the worker will be told

the outcome of the investigation and the recommended course of action. If no action is to be

taken, the reason for this will be explained.

Stage 3. If the worker is concerned that WRAP has failed to make a proper investigation they

should inform the Investigation Officer who will arrange for another manager to review the

investigation carried out, make any necessary enquiries and make their own report to the CEO

and the Audit and Risk Committee as in stage 2 above. Any approach will be treated with the

strictest confidence and the worker's identity will not be disclosed without their prior consent. Stage 4. If on conclusion of stages 1, 2 and 3 the worker reasonably believes that the

appropriate action has not been taken, they can report the matter to the proper authority. The

legislation sets out a number of bodies to which qualifying disclosures may be made. These

include:

- 

- 

- 

- 

- 

- 

- 

The Charity Commission;

HM Revenue & Customs;

the Financial Conduct Authority (formerly the Financial Services Authority);

the Competition and Markets Authority;

the Health and Safety Executive;

the Environment Agency;

the Serious Fraud Office.

When an individual makes a disclosure, WRAP will process any personal data collected in accordance with its data protection policy. Data collected from the point at which the individual makes the report is held securely and accessed by, and disclosed to, individuals only for the purposes of dealing with the disclosure.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires employers to comply with principles for

processing personal data, including protecting against unauthorised access of personal data.

Personal data that is inappropriately accessed or disclosed may constitute a data breach. The

GDPR requires organisations to keep a record of all data breaches and, where the breach is likely

to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the organisation must notify the

workers have a right to make a disclosure if there is a legitimate reason to do so; workers are protected under whistleblowing procedures; disclosures should be raised with the appropriate Investigating Officer; the need for confidentiality will be respected; all disclosures will be investigated following an agreed process; the outcome of the investigation, including the recommended course of action, will be reported to the CEO, the Audit and Risk Committee and to the whistleblower; if the whistleblower is not happy with the outcome of the investigation, they can report the matter to the proper authority.

Information Commissioner within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach. If the data breach

results in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, those individuals must be notified

without undue delay.

Section 43J of the Employment Rights Act 1996 provides that a settlement agreement made between a worker and an employer cannot prevent future protected disclosures.

Any confidentiality obligations in contracts of employment that would prevent a worker making a

protected disclosure will be void.
