# Green Orbit Digital Ethical Screening Policy

POL/ETH/2025/1472-V1.1

# Mission Alignment

At Green Orbit Digital, our mission is to propel sustainable marketing in the space industry while minimising harm to people and the planet. Every project we take on is a launch opportunity—a chance to support ventures that align with our vision of a greener space sector. To ensure we stay on course, we apply a rigorous ethical screening process to all potential clients and projects, categorising them as GO for launch, NO-GO for ethical concerns, or requiring further HOLD status review.

# Ethical Screening Flight Plan

Step 1 – Initial Mission Assessment

All incoming leads are assigned to a Mission Control (Business Development) specialist for initial evaluation.

Step 2 – NO-GO Screening

If a project or client is primarily engaged in or financially dependent on any of the following, it is immediately classified as NO-GO, and the mission is scrubbed.

Prohibited NO-GO Criteria:

🚀 Fossil Fuel Reliance: Extraction, refinement, or heavy lobbying for oil, gas, or coal industries.

🛰 Weapons & Conflict: Arms manufacturing, military offensive systems, or organisations linked to war profiteering.

🌍 Environmental Destruction: Projects contributing significantly to deforestation, ocean degradation, or harmful extractive industries.

🐾 Animal Exploitation: Commercial animal agriculture, animal testing, or industries profiting from unethical wildlife trade.

🎰 Predatory Practices: Gambling, payday lending, or exploitative financial services.

📢 Disinformation & Extremism: Clients engaged in spreading hate speech, misinformation, or operating in an undemocratic manner.

🚭 Harmful Consumer Goods: Tobacco, unhealthy products marketed at children, or substances proven to cause significant harm.

If a lead falls into any of these categories, the countdown is aborted immediately.

Step 3 – HOLD Screening

If a lead clears the NO-GO criteria, it moves to the HOLD stage for further evaluation. The Mission Control team will analyse the project based on:

🔍 Mixed Signals: Does the client engage in both positive and questionable activities?

🌑 Lack of Impact: Does the project fail to contribute meaningfully to people or planet?

🌐 Ties to NO-GO Industries: Are there ownership, funding, or lobbying links to industries we prohibit?

📜 Past Ethics Violations: Has the organisation been accused of environmental, labour, or social injustices?

🏛 Political & Ethical Ambiguity: Does the project involve politically sensitive or ethically grey areas?

🤝 Cultural Fit: Does the organisation’s approach align with our values, or does something feel off?

🚦 Gut Check: Does the project feel ethically questionable upon deeper review?

If any of these factors raise concerns, the case is escalated to the Mission Review Board (Senior Leadership Team) for a go/no-go decision.

Step 4 – Mission Review Board (SLT Decision)

The Mission Review Board will conduct a final go/no-go poll based on the HOLD criteria.

🟢 GO: If no ethical concerns remain, the project is cleared for takeoff.

🔴 NO-GO: If concerns outweigh positive impact, the project is declined.

🟡 HOLD: If additional information is needed, further due diligence is conducted before a final decision.

In the event of a split decision, the CEO or a designated officer will cast the deciding vote.

Step 5 – Proceed or Abort

If a project receives a GO for launch, it moves into onboarding. If classified as NO-GO, the lead is formally declined with a transparent and respectful response.

To maintain mission integrity, all decisions are logged for future reference in our CRM mission logs.

# Continuous Course Correction

As in spaceflight, conditions evolve. We periodically recalibrate our ethical policy to stay aligned with industry best practices and global sustainability standards. Team members and clients are encouraged to provide input for ongoing improvements.

Green Orbit Digital’s ethical trajectory is clear: We support missions that contribute positively to the planet, space industry, and society while avoiding ventures that contradict our values.

🌍 A more sustainable space sector begins with responsible choices.
