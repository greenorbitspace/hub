Free linking policy: drafting notes

This free linking policy has the same basic content as our regular linking policy.

This linking policy has been created for website operators who want to set out, in detail, their policies relating to hyperlinking. The default provisions state a website's policies in relation to both links from the website and incoming links.

This type of linking policy is relatively unusual, but may nonetheless be useful in respect of some types of website.

NB There is some cross-over between the content of this free linking policy, and the treatment of user-provided content in many of our T&Cs of use for websites.
