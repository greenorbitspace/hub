In the tragic event that you experience the death of somebody close to you, whether family or friend, we’ll be there to support you through this period and we understand that you’re likely to need some time off work.

When you’re able to, please let us know about the bereavement. You may take one full day off initially, along with a half or full day to attend the funeral. This time will be fully paid and will not affect your holiday entitlement. It should be noted in Bamboo under ‘compassionate leave’.

Everybody experiences bereavements differently, and we understand that you may need more time off. If you need more time, please discuss this with us and we will make a decision on a case-by-case basis to determine whether you can take additional paid or unpaid leave until you feel ready to return to work.

If you prefer the distraction of coming to work, that’s also fine. Just let us know what we can do to support you at this difficult time.
