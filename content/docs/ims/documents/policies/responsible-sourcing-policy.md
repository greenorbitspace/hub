# Policy Statement

Green Orbit Digital is committed to responsible sourcing practices that promote sustainability, ethical conduct, and positive social impact throughout our supply chain. This policy establishes the framework for ensuring our procurement decisions align with our environmental, social, and economic values.

## Scope

This policy applies to all procurement activities, suppliers, contractors, and service providers engaged by Green Orbit Digital. It covers all stages of the sourcing process, from supplier selection to performance monitoring.

## Key Principles

### 1. Environmental Responsibility

- Source materials and services with minimal environmental impact

- Prioritize suppliers with environmental certifications (e.g., ISO 14001, EU Ecolabel)

- Promote waste reduction and resource efficiency in the supply chain

### 2. Social and Ethical Standards

- Ensure fair labor practices and safe working conditions

- Support diversity and inclusion in supplier selection

- Prohibit modern slavery and human trafficking

### 3. Supplier Selection Criteria

- Sustainability commitment and environmental performance

- Quality and reliability standards

- Financial stability and risk management capabilities

- Compliance with applicable laws and regulations

### 4. Monitoring and Evaluation

- Regular supplier audits and performance reviews

- Tracking of sustainability metrics and improvements

- Documentation of compliance with policy requirements

## Implementation

All procurement decisions must consider environmental and social impacts alongside traditional factors such as cost and quality. Suppliers are required to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and ethical practices through appropriate documentation and ongoing performance measurement.

## Compliance and Reporting

Non-compliance with this policy may result in termination of supplier relationships. Regular reports on responsible sourcing performance will be provided to senior management.
