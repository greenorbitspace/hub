Introduction

Background

Green Orbit Digital is a sustainability-driven marketing agency focused on integrating eco-conscious solutions into the space industry. As a remote-first organisation, we are deeply committed to reducing our environmental impact while promoting social responsibility and strong governance practices. Our approach to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ensures that sustainability is embedded in every aspect of our operations, from internal practices to client interactions. We recognise that sustainability is not only a responsibility but a driving force for innovation, and we strive to lead by example in advancing sustainability across the space sector.

Aims of the ESG Policy

The primary aim of Green Orbit Digital’s ESG Policy is to define our strategy for integrating sustainable practices across all aspects of our business operations, ensuring that sustainability is at the heart of everything we do. This policy serves as a guiding framework for all stakeholders—including employees, clients, suppliers, and partners—committing us to contribute positively to the environment, society, and governance structures.

Our ESG goals are built around three key pillars:

- Environmental Responsibility: We aim to reduce Green Orbit Digital’s environmental impact by implementing sustainable business practices, optimising resource efficiency, and supporting sustainable innovations, particularly within the space industry. This includes actively driving initiatives that minimise our carbon footprint and promoting eco-conscious solutions in our client services.

- Social Responsibility: We strive to create a positive social impact by fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion, while ensuring the well-being and development of our employees and the communities we engage with. Our commitment to social responsibility extends beyond internal practices, encouraging responsible marketing and actions that benefit society at large.

- Governance Excellence: We are committed to maintaining the highest ethical standards across all levels of our organisation. This includes ensuring transparency, accountability, and responsible decision-making processes in everything we do, from reporting to stakeholder engagement.

Through this policy, we reflect our commitment to achieving measurable sustainability outcomes that align with global environmental standards, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By embedding these principles into our culture, operations, and client services, we seek to drive meaningful change within the space industry and beyond, promoting sustainability across our entire value chain.

Success Factors

The success of our ESG policy is driven by several key factors:

- Supplier Selection: Choosing partners who align with our sustainability values ensures that we maintain a responsible supply chain and contribute to a circular economy. This ensures that all external parties adhere to the same environmental, social, and governance standards that we set for ourselves.

- Employee Engagement: Providing ongoing education and resources to empower employees to make sustainable choices. Our commitment to employee development ensures that our team is equipped to drive sustainability initiatives both within the company and in client projects.

- Stakeholder Communication: Maintaining clear, transparent communication with stakeholders about our sustainability objectives, progress, and challenges. We believe that sharing our journey fosters collaboration and holds us accountable to our goals.

- Continuous Improvement: Regular evaluations of our ESG goals ensure we stay current with evolving best practices, feedback from stakeholders, and emerging sustainability trends. This proactive approach allows us to refine our strategies and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of environmental, social, and governance issues.

PDCA Model (Plan-Do-Check-Act)

To ensure the effectiveness of our ESG policy, Green Orbit Digital adopts the PDCA model, a systematic approach that allows for continuous refinement and improvement of our ESG practices:

- Plan: Define sustainability goals and integrate them into business strategies. This phase includes identifying key areas for improvement, setting measurable targets, and developing action plans that align with our overall business objectives.

- Do: Implement sustainable practices across all functions, from operations to client services. We ensure that ESG principles are embedded in every aspect of our work, from procurement and supply chain management to marketing strategies and client consultations.

- Check: Monitor and assess progress regularly to ensure that our actions align with our environmental, social, and governance objectives. This phase involves evaluating performance against key performance indicators (KPIs), conducting audits, and engaging stakeholders in discussions to gather feedback.

- Act: Take corrective actions as needed, refining our strategies and practices to continuously improve our ESG performance. Whether adjusting goals, reallocating resources, or introducing new initiatives, this phase ensures that we remain on track towards our long-term sustainability objectives.

This approach ensures that Green Orbit Digital remains accountable, adaptive, and committed to driving sustainability in the space industry. By following the PDCA model, we can build a resilient and responsible business that not only meets current ESG challenges but also anticipates future opportunities for improvement and innovation.

Green Orbit Digital is committed to complying with the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS) standards. The ESG policy is designed to align with the principles of ISO 14001, ensuring that we manage our environmental impact in a structured and effective way. This includes establishing environmental objectives, implementing appropriate actions to achieve them, conducting regular monitoring, and fostering continual improvement in our environmental performance.

Intended Outcomes

The intended outcomes of this ESG Policy are:

We aim to achieve measurable progress in all ESG areas, demonstrating leadership in sustainability within the space industry and setting an example for other organisations to follow.

Continuous Improvement

Green Orbit Digital is committed to the principle of continuous improvement. We understand that the journey to sustainability is ongoing and that improvement requires constant review and adaptation. Through regular monitoring, feedback, and evaluation of our ESG initiatives, we will refine our policies and actions to improve both environmental performance and broader ESG outcomes. This process is supported by our Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, which enables us to assess our practices, address challenges, and implement corrective actions in real-time.

Exclusions

This ESG policy does not cover areas outside the direct control of Green Orbit Digital, such as activities conducted by third-party contractors or suppliers that fall outside our partnerships or agreed sustainability criteria. However, we will engage with suppliers to encourage them to align with our sustainability goals and monitor their performance against agreed sustainability benchmarks.

Stakeholder Communications

We are committed to maintaining transparent and open communication with all relevant stakeholders, including employees, clients, suppliers, partners, and the wider community.

We aim to build long-term relationships with stakeholders based on trust, transparency, and shared responsibility towards sustainability.

Reviews and Updates

The ESG Policy will undergo an annual review, conducted by the CEO, CTO, or other designated leadership, to assess its effectiveness and relevance. During this review, we will evaluate the progress of our ESG objectives, reflect on any new sustainability trends, and update the policy where necessary. Any changes made will be communicated to all stakeholders, ensuring continued alignment with our corporate sustainability goals.

Integration with Other Management Systems

Green Orbit Digital’s ESG Policy is designed to integrate seamlessly with other management systems, including quality management (ISO 9001), information security management (ISO 27001), and health and safety management. By aligning these systems with our ESG efforts, we ensure a holistic approach to organisational performance and sustainability. This integration helps streamline processes, improve operational efficiency, and achieve our broader sustainability goals.

Monitoring and Measurement

To track progress against our ESG objectives, Green Orbit Digital has established key performance indicators (KPIs) and monitoring processes. Regular measurement will help us assess our performance in areas such as carbon emissions, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, and supply chain sustainability. We will conduct quarterly internal reviews to ensure our initiatives are on track and will prepare an annual report to communicate progress to stakeholders. These measurements will be aligned with the ISO 14001 monitoring requirements, ensuring consistency in reporting and assessment.

By continuously monitoring and measuring our performance, we ensure that Green Orbit Digital remains accountable and responsive in its pursuit of a sustainable future.

# Policy Integration

At Green Orbit Digital, we recognise the importance of effectively integrating our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) policies across all levels of the organisation. Achieving our sustainability and ethical goals requires the full commitment of senior management, internal functions, employees, partners, and suppliers, all of whom play critical roles in adhering to the principles set out in this policy. A strong culture of responsibility, engagement, and accountability ensures the successful implementation and long-term impact of our ESG initiatives.

1. Commitment Across All Levels

To embed ESG principles effectively, it is essential that all stakeholders within the organisation—from senior leadership to external partners—align with the company’s ESG values. This commitment is not only about policy adherence but also about actively supporting the ongoing evolution and execution of ESG strategies.

- Senior Management Engagement: The Board of Directors at Green Orbit Digital takes overall responsibility for ensuring that ESG goals are integrated into the company's strategic vision and objectives. The CEO is tasked with overseeing the implementation of ESG policies at the highest level, ensuring that sustainability remains a priority across the business.

- Internal Functions and Employees: Every department within Green Orbit Digital is expected to incorporate ESG considerations into their daily operations. Department heads, managers, and employees will be responsible for carrying out initiatives in alignment with ESG targets, with clear ownership of key initiatives at the departmental level.

- Partners and Suppliers: Our commitment to ESG extends beyond the organisation itself. We require all partners, suppliers, and collaborators to adhere to the principles of our ESG policy. This includes integrating sustainability into their operations, sourcing practices, and business models, ensuring that our entire supply chain reflects our ethical and sustainability values.

2. Ownership and Accountability

We understand that successful policy integration depends on clear ownership and accountability for ESG initiatives. Each business function will take responsibility for implementing specific elements of the ESG policy, with designated leaders ensuring these areas are effectively managed.

- ESG Committee (or equivalent): A dedicated ESG Committee, chaired by an executive sponsor, will be responsible for overseeing the integration of ESG initiatives throughout the organisation. This committee will include representatives from key functions such as finance, operations, marketing, human resources, and sustainability.

- ESG Sponsor: At Green Orbit Digital, the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) or another senior leader (depending on the structure) will act as the designated ESG Sponsor. This individual will own the ESG policy and be the main point of contact for all ESG-related initiatives. The sponsor will ensure coordination across departments and act as a conduit between the ESG Committee, executive leadership, and the Board of Directors.

- Individual Ownership: Each ESG initiative will have a designated owner, typically an executive or senior manager within the corresponding business area. These individuals are responsible for driving the initiatives within their remit, ensuring the initiatives are implemented according to plan, and providing regular updates on progress.

3. Monitoring and Reporting

Monitoring the implementation of ESG initiatives and measuring progress against established goals is crucial to ensuring the success of the policy integration. At Green Orbit Digital, we are committed to tracking our ESG efforts transparently and ensuring timely reporting to stakeholders.

- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): We have established clear KPIs for our ESG initiatives that are aligned with both our business objectives and our sustainability goals. These KPIs are designed to measure the performance and impact of each ESG initiative, covering areas such as carbon emissions, waste reduction, diversity and inclusion, ethical sourcing, and community engagement.

- Quarterly Monitoring: The ESG Committee will meet quarterly to review the progress of the ESG initiatives. This will involve an analysis of the KPIs, identification of any areas for improvement, and the formulation of action plans to address any challenges or gaps. These meetings will also ensure that all departments are held accountable for their respective responsibilities within the ESG strategy.

- Annual Reporting to the Board: The ESG Sponsor will compile a comprehensive annual ESG report that synthesises data, progress, and outcomes from all business areas. This report will be presented to the Board of Directors and will include insights on areas of success, areas needing improvement, and future strategic actions to further enhance our ESG efforts.

4. Continuous Improvement and Policy Adaptation

The implementation of ESG policy is an ongoing process. We are committed to continuously improving our approach and adapting to emerging trends, regulations, and stakeholder expectations. We acknowledge that ESG issues evolve and require dynamic responses to remain relevant and impactful.

- Annual ESG Review: Green Orbit Digital will conduct a full review of its ESG strategy and policies annually. This review will assess the effectiveness of our current ESG efforts, identify new opportunities, and incorporate feedback from stakeholders, ensuring that our policy stays aligned with industry best practices.

- Feedback and Adaptation: Our approach to ESG policy integration includes a feedback loop from employees, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, ensuring that we continually adapt our strategy to meet evolving expectations. We will engage with stakeholders through surveys, consultations, and regular communication channels to ensure their insights are considered in our ESG decision-making.

5. Transparent Communication and Stakeholder Engagement

Green Orbit Digital is committed to transparent communication of our ESG progress to all stakeholders, including employees, customers, investors, suppliers, and the wider community. We believe that ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders is essential to understanding their concerns, expectations, and needs regarding ESG issues.

- Regular ESG Updates: We will provide quarterly updates to internal and external stakeholders, sharing key achievements, challenges, and the steps we are taking to improve our ESG performance. These updates will be shared through internal communications channels, annual reports, and through direct engagement with stakeholders.

- Engagement and Partnerships: We actively seek opportunities to collaborate with industry groups, NGOs, and other stakeholders to share best practices, contribute to broader ESG goals, and drive collective impact. We also encourage open dialogue with customers and partners to understand their expectations around sustainability and ethical business practices.

6. Compliance and Legal Considerations

As part of our policy integration process, Green Orbit Digital ensures full compliance with all relevant ESG regulations and standards, including local, national, and international laws. This includes compliance with environmental regulations, labour laws, human rights frameworks, and anti-corruption policies.

- ESG Legal Compliance: We are committed to staying up-to-date with the latest ESG-related laws and regulations, ensuring that our practices meet legal requirements in all jurisdictions where we operate.

- Policy Alignment with Global Standards: Our ESG initiatives will be aligned with internationally recognised frameworks, including the UN Global Compact, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to ensure that our actions meet global standards for sustainability and corporate responsibility.

Conclusion

Effective policy integration is fundamental to achieving Green Orbit Digital's sustainability goals. By securing commitment from all levels of the organisation, ensuring clear ownership of initiatives, and monitoring progress through KPIs and regular reporting, we can ensure the continued success of our ESG strategy. With a robust framework in place, Green Orbit Digital will continue to integrate ESG principles into the heart of our business operations, fostering a culture of sustainability, transparency, and accountability.

ESG Integration

Our approach includes:

Evaluating Clients' ESG Alignment

Before entering into any marketing partnership, we assess potential clients to ensure their business values align with our ESG principles. We do not engage with companies associated with controversial practices or those that violate human rights.

ESG Due Diligence

Our marketing campaigns undergo rigorous ESG due diligence, conducted in parallel with commercial assessments. This evaluation helps us identify and manage ESG risks in our marketing strategies, ensuring they align with the sustainability goals of our clients.

Policy Implementation and Review

This policy is effective as of October 2023 and will be reviewed regularly to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness in guiding our commitment to ESG principles.

We have developed a comprehensive screening toolbox to evaluate potential partners, ensuring their practices align with our environmental and ethical standards. We extend our expertise to help partners and clients embark on their sustainability journeys.
