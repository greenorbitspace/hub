# EMPLOYEE AND WORKER DATA PROTECTION POLICY

<!-- Unsupported block type: table -->

Introduction

In the course of your work with our Company you are likely to collect, use, transfer or store personal information about employees, clients, customers and suppliers, for example their names and home addresses.  The UK’s data protection legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) contains strict principles and legal conditions which must be followed before and during any processing of any personal information.

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that you are aware that everyone has a responsibility to comply with the principles and legal conditions provided by the data protection legislation, including the GDPR and failure to meet those responsibilities are likely to lead to serious consequences. Firstly, a serious breach of data protection is likely to be a disciplinary offence and will be dealt with under the Company’s disciplinary procedure. If you access another employee’s personnel records or any sensitive personal information without authority, this will constitute a gross misconduct offence and could lead to your summary dismissal. Additionally, if you knowingly or recklessly disclose personal data in breach of the data protection legislation, including the GDPR you may be held personally criminally accountable for any such breach.

Breach of the data protection legislation, including the GDPR rules can cause distress to the individuals affected by the breach and is likely to leave the Company at risk of serious financial consequences.

If you are in any doubt about what you can or cannot disclose and to whom, do not disclose the personal information until you have sought further advice from the Company’s CHOOSE ONE: [Data Protection Officer - INSERT NAME AND CONTACT DETAILS ] OR [Data Representative - INSERT NAME AND CONTACT DETAILS ].

This policy does not form part of a contract of employment. However, it is mandatory that all employees, workers or contractors must read, understand and comply with the content of this policy and you must attend associated training relating to its content and operation. Failure to adhere to this policy is likely to be regarded as a serious disciplinary matter and will be dealt with under the Company’s disciplinary rules and procedures.

Definitions

Data Subject: a living individual.

Data Controller: the person or organisation that determines the means and the purpose of processing the personal data.

Data Protection Legislation: includes (i) the Data Protection Act 2018, (ii) the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (GDPR) and any national implementing laws, regulations and secondary legislation, for so long as the GDPR is effective in the UK, and (iii) any successor and supplemental legislation to the Data Protection Act 1998 and the GDPR, in particular the Data Protection Bill 2017-2019 and the E-Privacy Directive (and its proposed replacement), once it becomes law.

Personal data: is any information that identifies a living individual (data subject) either directly or indirectly. This also includes special categories of personal data. Personal data does not include data which is entirely anonymous or the identity has been permanently removed making it impossible to link back to the data subject.

Processing: is any activity relating to personal data which can include collecting, recording, storing, amending, disclosing, transferring, retrieving, using or destruction.

Special categories of personal data: this includes any personal data which reveals a data subject’s, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious and philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic, biometric or health data, sex life and sexual orientation.

Criminal records data: means information about an individual's criminal convictions and offences, and information relating to criminal allegations and proceedings.

What are the GDPR principles?

We are a data controller. This means that we are required by law to ensure that everyone who processes personal data and special categories of personal data during the course of their work with us does so in accordance with the data protection legislation, including the GDPR principles. In brief, the principles say that:

- Personal data must be processed in a lawful, fair and transparent way.

- The purpose for which the personal information is collected must be specific, explicit and legitimate.

- The collected personal data must be adequate and relevant to meet the identified purpose.

- The information must be accurate and kept up to date.

- The personal data should not be kept in a form which permits identification of a data subject for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is used.

- The personal data must be kept confidential and secure and only processed by authorised personnel.

Other rules under the GDPR state that:

- The transfer of personal data to a country or organisation outside the EEA should only take place if appropriate measures are in place to protect the security of that data.

- The data subject must be permitted to exercise their rights in relation to their personal data.

The Company and all employees must comply with these principles and rules at all times in their information-handling practices. We are committed to ensuring that these principles and rules are followed, as we take the security and protection of data very seriously.

You must inform us immediately if you become aware that any of these principles or rules have been breached or are likely to be breached.

What are the lawful reasons under which we would expect you to process personal data?

Whilst carrying out your work activities you are likely to process personal data. The Company will only expect you to process personal data where the business has a lawful basis (or bases) to process that information. The lawful basis may be any one of the following reasons or a combination of:

1. Consent has been obtained the data subject to process their personal data for specified purposes.

1. Where we need to perform the contract we have entered into with the data subject either for employment or commercial purposes.

1. Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.

1. Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject do not override those interests.

There are other rare occasions where you may need to process the data subjects personal information, these include:

1. Where we need to protect the data subject’s interests (or someone else’s interests).

1. Where it is needed in the public interest IF RELEVANT: [or for official purposes].

You must always ensure that you keep a documentary inventory of the legal basis (or bases) which is being relied on in respect of each processing activity which you perform.

Privacy Notices

- Personal data must be processed in a lawful, fair and transparent way.

Before you begin collecting or processing personal data directly from a data subject you must ensure that an appropriate privacy notice has been issued to the data subject. Different notices are used for employment and commercial purposes. The content of the privacy notice must provide accurate, transparent and unambiguous details of the lawful and fair reason for why we are processing the data. It must also explain how, when and for how long we propose to process the data subjects personal information. We need to include information around the data subjects’ rights and most importantly, the notice should also explain how we will keep the information secure and protected against unauthorised use.

Where you intend to collect data indirectly from a third party or a public source (i.e. electoral register), you must ensure that a privacy notice is issued to the data subject within a reasonable of period of obtaining the personal data and no later than one month; if the data is used to communicate with the individual, at the latest, when the first communication takes place; or if disclosure to someone else is envisaged, at the latest, when the data is disclosed.

You must only use data collected indirectly if you have evidence that it has been collected in accordance with the GDPR principles.

In all circumstances you must check that you are using an up to date version of the Company’s privacy notice and it is being used in accordance with the Company’s guidelines.

Purpose Limitation

- The purpose for which the personal information is collected must be specific, explicit and legitimate.

When you collect personal information you will set out in the privacy notice how that information will be used. If it becomes necessary to use that information for a reason other than the reason which you have previously identified you must usually stop processing that information. However, in limited circumstances you can continue to process the information provided that your new reason for processing the personal information remains compatible with your original lawful purpose (unless your original lawful basis was consent).

Adequate and relevant

- The collected personal data must be adequate and relevant to meet the identified purpose.

You must only process personal data where you have been authorised to do so because it relates to your work or you have been delegated temporary responsibility to process the information. You must not collect, store or use unnecessary personal data and you must ensure that personal data is deleted, erased or removed within the Company’s retention guidelines. You must not process or use personal data for non-work related purposes.

The Company will review its records and in particular employees’ personnel files on a regular basis to ensure they do not contain a backlog of out-of-date or irrelevant information and to check there are lawful reasons requiring information to continue to be held.

Accurate and kept up to date

- The information must be accurate and kept up to date.

If your personal information changes, for example you change address or you get married and change your surname, you must inform your line manager as soon as practicable so that the Company’s records can be updated.  The Company will not be responsible for any inaccurate personal data held on its systems where you have failed to notify it of the relevant change in circumstances.

Kept for longer than is necessary

- The personal data should not be kept in a form which permits identification of a data subject for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is used.

Different categories of personal data will be retained for different periods of time, depending on legal, operational and financial requirements.  Any data which the Company decides it does not need to hold for a particular period of time will be destroyed in accordance with its retention of data policy.

Kept confidential and secure

- The personal data must be kept confidential and secure and only processed by authorised personnel.

To achieve this you must follow these steps:

- The Company has in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to data. These procedures must always be adhered to and not overridden or ignored.

- Where the Company provides you with code words or passwords to be used before releasing personal information, for example by telephone, you must strictly follow the Company’s requirements in this regard.

- Only transmit personal information between locations by fax or e-mail if a secure network is in place, for example, a confidential fax machine or encryption is used for e-mail.

- Ensure that any personal data which you hold is kept securely, either in a locked filing cabinet or, if it is computerised, it is password protected so that it is protected from unintended destruction or change and is not seen by unauthorised persons.

- Do not access another employee’s records without authority as this will be treated as gross misconduct and it is also a criminal offence.

- Do not write down (in electronic or hard copy form) opinions or facts concerning a data subject which would be inappropriate to share with that data subject.

- Do not remove personal information from the workplace with the intention of processing it elsewhere unless this is necessary to enable you to carry out your job duties and has been authorised by your line manager.

- Ensure that when working on personal information as part of your job duties when away from your workplace and with the authorisation of your line manager, you continue to observe the terms of this policy and the data protection legislation, in particular in matters of data security.

- Ensure that hard copy personal information is disposed of securely, for example cross-shredded.

- Manual personnel files and data subject files are confidential and are stored INSERT DETAILS for example in locked filing cabinets. Only authorised employees have access to these files. For a list of authorised employees, please contact CHOOSE ONE: INSERT NAME, the Company’s Data Protection Officer OR INSERT NAME OF DATA REPRESENTATIVE. These will not be removed from their normal place of storage without good reason.

- Data stored on memory sticks, discs, portable hard drives or other removable storage media is kept INSERT DETAILS for example in locked filing cabinets.

- Data held on computers are stored confidentially by means of INSERT DETAILS for example password protection, encryption or coding.

- The Company has network back-up procedures to ensure that data on computers cannot be accidentally lost or destroyed. More information on the Company’s security policies can be obtained by contacting INSERT DETAILS.

Transfer to another country

- Transfer of personal data to countries or organisations outside of the EEA should only take place if appropriate measures are in place to protect the security of that data.

We do not generally have a need to transfer data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). However, if you are requested to transfer personal data to a country or organisation outside of the EEA you must not transfer personal data to a country or organisation unless that country or organisation ensures an adequate level of protection in relation to the processing of personal data and you have in place safeguards to ensure this is done. You must speak to CHOOSE ONE: [the Data Protection Officer] OR [Data Representative] before you send personal data outside of the EEA.

The data subject rights

- The data subject must be permitted to exercise their rights in relation to their personal data.

Under the GDPR, subject to certain legal limitations, data subjects have available a number of legal rights regarding how their personal data is processed. At any time a data subject can request that the Company should take any of the following actions, subject to certain legal limitations, with regard to their personal data:

- Allow access to the personal data

- Request corrections to be made to data

- Request erasure of data

- Object to the processing of data

- Request that processing restrictions be put in place

- Request a transfer of personal data

- Object to automated decision making

- Right to be notified of a data security breach

There are different rules and timeframes that apply to each of these rights. You must follow the Company’s policies and procedures whenever you process or receive a request in relation to any of the above rights.

How should you respond to a data subject request?

You must follow the Company’s data subject access procedure which details how to deal with requests and it describes the circumstances where a fee may be charged. The procedure includes the following:

- Always verify the identity of the person making a data subject request and the legitimacy of the request.

- If you are unsure as to whether you are authorised to action the request check the privacy notice to ascertain who is authorised to deal with data subject requests. If you are still unsure how to handle the enquiry, you should forward this to CHOOSE ONE: [the Data Protection Officer] OR contact [INSERT DETAILS, our Data Representative].

- If you are authorised to deal with the request do not give out confidential personal information unless you have received the appropriate consent from the data subject. Seek explicit written consent to process the data subject request and ensure that you keep a clear audit trail of the request and your response.

- Do not share personal information with a third party, unless the data subject has given their explicit prior consent to the sharing of their information. A third party is anyone who is not the actual data subject and can include a family member of the data subject.

- Take great care not to accidentally share information with an unauthorised third party.

Be aware that those seeking information sometimes use deception in order to gain access to it.

Categories of information

During the course of your employment you may be required to process personal data which falls into different categories, general personal data and special categories of personal data. All data should be processed in accordance with the privacy notice and at all times in a confidential manner. However, where that data is classed as a special category extra care should be taken to ensure the privacy and security of that data. This means that you should maintain a high level of security and you should only share this data with those who are also authorised to process that data. In the context of employee relations the scenarios when you may be required to process special categories information may arise for one or more of the following reasons:

- In order to comply with employment and other laws when processing and managing situations connected with absences arising in relation to sickness or family/ dependant related leave.

- To ensure health and safety obligations and other employment related obligations are met you may be required to process information about the physical or mental health or disability status of an employee in order to assess their capability to perform a role. You may also be required to monitor and manage sickness absence, recommend appropriate workplace adjustments and administer health related benefits.

- Where it is needed in the public interest, for example for equal opportunity monitoring and reporting.

- And any other reasons which we advise you of under a separate policy or notice.

We may also require you to process special categories of information in connection with customers and other third parties.

There may also be circumstances where we ask you to process this type of information in relation to assisting the Company with legal claims or to protect a data subjects interests (or someone else’s).

You may be asked to process information in relation to criminal convictions. This should be processed with the highest degree of confidentiality and in accordance with any data protection legislation and privacy notices that are in force in our business.

If you are unsure about how you should process general personal data or special categories of personal data, you must contact the CHOOSE ONE: [Data Protection Officer] OR [Data Representative].

When will you need to seek consent?

In limited circumstances during your work you may need consent from a data subject in order to process personal data or special categories of data. You will be provided with training and details of which circumstances consent is needed and the type of consent that should be sought.

However, in limited circumstances, you may find it necessary to request a data subject to provide written consent to allow the processing of special categories of personal data. You will be provided with training and details of which circumstances consent is needed and the type of consent that should be sought. For example, in an employment context you should request the data subject’s written consent to instruct a medical practitioner to prepare a medical report.  If it becomes necessary to request consent to process special categories of personal data, you must provide the data subject with details of the information that will be required and why it is needed, so that they can make an informed decision as to whether they wish to provide consent.

You must not compel a data subject to provide written consent. Giving consent will always be a decision made by freewill and choice and is not a contractual condition. Consent can be withdrawn at any time without any reason provided. You must not subject a data subject to a sanction or detriment as a consequence of withdrawing consent. This would be viewed a serious disciplinary issue.

Exemptions

In limited circumstances there are certain categories of personal data which are exempt from the GDPR regime. In an employment context these include:

- Confidential references that are given by the Company to, (or to be given to) third parties or received by the Company from third parties. Only designated line managers can give Company references. Confidential references will not be provided unless the Company is sure this is the employee’s wish.

- Management forecasts and management planning (including documents setting out management plans for an employee’s future development and progress).

- Data which is required by law to be publicly available.

- Documents subject to legal professional privilege.

Action to be taken in the event of a data protection breach

A personal data breach will arise whenever any personal data is lost, destroyed, corrupted or disclosed; if someone accesses the data or passes it on without proper authorisation; or if the data is made unavailable and this unavailability has a significant negative effect on a data subject.

In the event of a security incident or breach, do not try to handle this yourself.

You must follow the Company’s Data Breach Policy which includes immediately informing CHOOSE ONE: [the Data Protection Officer] OR [the Data Representative] so that steps can be taken to:

- Contain the breach;

- Assess the potential adverse consequences for individuals, based on how serious or substantial these are, and how likely they are to happen; and

- To limit the scope of the breach by taking steps to mitigate the effects of the breach.

The CHOOSE ONE: [Data Protection Officer] OR [Data Representative] will determine within 72 hours the seriousness of the breach and if the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and/or data subjects need to be notified of the breach.

- [As we have fewer than 250 employees, we only need to document processing activities that:

Training

All employees that handle personal information of individuals must have a basic understanding of the data protection legislation, including the GDPR. Staff with duties such as computer and internet security, marketing and database management may need specialist training to make them aware of particular data protection requirements in their work area.

We will provide you with continuous training and updates on how to process personal data in a secure and confidential manner and in accordance with the spirit of the data protection legislation, including the GDPR. You will be required to attend all training and to keep yourself informed and aware of any changes made to privacy notices, consent procedures and any other policies and procedures associated with our internal processing of personal data.

You must regularly review all your data processing activities and ensure that you are acting in accordance with the most current best practice and legal obligations in relation to data security and confidentiality.

Automated processing and decision making

From time to time we may use computer programmes to process data and make automated decisions. We will provide you with a separate notice explaining when and how this happens. Where automated processing or decision making does take place and the effect of that processing impacts on the freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject, then in certain circumstances the data subject can request for human intervention. This means that they can ask for a human to review the machine made outcome/decision.

Sharing personal data

We may share personal data internally as is necessary. You must always ensure that personal data is only shared with authorised persons and is shared in accordance with the purposes stated in any privacy notice or consents. Extra care and security must be taken when sharing special categories of data or transferring data outside of the Company to a third party.

Direct Marketing

We are subject to specific rules under the GDPR in relation to marketing our services. Data subjects have the right to reject direct marketing and we must ensure that data subjects are given this option at first point of contact. When a data subject exercises their right to reject marketing you must desist immediately from sending further communications.

What are the UK GDPR principles?

We are a data controller. This means that we are required by law to ensure that everyone who processes personal data and special categories of personal data during the course of their work with us does so in accordance with the data protection legislation, including the UK GDPR principles. In brief, the principles say that:

- Personal data must be processed in a lawful, fair and transparent way.

- The collected personal data must be adequate and relevant to meet the identified purpose.

- The information must be accurate and kept up to date.

- The personal data should not be kept in a form which permits identification of a data subject for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is used.

- The personal data must be kept confidential and secure and only processed by authorised personnel.

Other rules under the UK GDPR state that:

- The transfer of personal data to a country or organisation outside the UK should only take place if appropriate safeguarding measures are in place to protect the security of that data.

- The data subject must be permitted to exercise their rights in relation to their personal data.

The Company and all employees must comply with these principles and rules at all times in their information-handling practices. We are committed to ensuring that these principles and rules are followed, as we take the security and protection of data very seriously.

You must inform us immediately if you become aware that any of these principles or rules have been breached or are likely to be breached.

What are the lawful reasons under which we would expect you to process personal data?

Whilst carrying out your work activities you are likely to process personal data. The Company will only expect you to process personal data where the business has a lawful basis (or bases) to process that information. The lawful basis may be any one of the following reasons or a combination of:

- Consent has been obtained from the data subject to process their personal data for specified purposes.

- Where we need to perform the contract we have entered into with the data subject, either for employment or commercial purposes.

- Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.

- Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and the interests and fundamental rights of the data subject do not override those interests.

There are other rare occasions where you may need to process the data subject’s personal information. These include:

- Where we need to protect the data subject’s interests (or someone else’s interests).

- Where it is needed in the public interest IF RELEVANT: [or for official purposes].

You must always ensure that you keep a documentary inventory of the legal basis (or bases) which is being relied on in respect of each processing activity which you perform.

Privacy Notices

- Personal data must be processed in a lawful, fair and transparent way.

Before you begin collecting or processing personal data directly from a data subject you must ensure that an appropriate privacy notice has been issued to the data subject. Different notices are used for employment and commercial purposes. The content of the privacy notice must provide accurate, transparent and unambiguous details of the lawful and fair reason for why we are processing the data. It must also explain how, when and for how long we propose to process the data subject’s personal information. We need to include information around the data subject’s rights and most importantly, the notice should also explain how we will keep the information secure and protected against unauthorised use.

Where you intend to collect data indirectly from a third party or a public source (i.e. electoral register), you must ensure that a privacy notice is issued to the data subject within a reasonable period of obtaining the personal data and no later than one month after. If the data is used to communicate with the individual,  then at the latest, it should be issued when the first communication takes place or, if disclosure to someone else is envisaged, a privacy notice should be issued, at the latest, when the data is disclosed.

You must only use data collected indirectly if you have evidence that it has been collected in accordance with the UK GDPR principles.

In all circumstances you must check that you are using an up–to-date version of the Company’s privacy notice and it is being used in accordance with the Company’s guidelines.

Purpose Limitation

- The purpose for which the personal information is collected must be specific, explicit and legitimate.

When you collect personal information you should set out in the privacy notice how that information will be used. If it becomes necessary to use that information for a reason other than the reason which you have previously identified, you must usually stop processing that information. However, in limited circumstances you can continue to process the information provided that your new reason for processing the personal information remains compatible with your original lawful purpose (unless your original lawful basis was ‘Consent’).

Adequate and relevant

- The collected personal data must be adequate and relevant to meet the identified purpose.

You must only process personal data where you have been authorised to do so because it relates to your work or you have been delegated temporary responsibility to process the information. You must not collect, store or use unnecessary personal data and you must ensure that personal data is deleted, erased or removed within the Company’s retention guidelines. You must not process or use personal data for non-work related purposes.

The Company will review its records and in particular employees’ personnel files on a regular basis to ensure they do not contain a backlog of out-of-date or irrelevant information and to check there are lawful reasons requiring information to continue to be held.

Accurate and kept up to date

- The information must be accurate and kept up-to-date.

If your personal information changes, for example you change address or you get married and change your surname, you must inform your line manager as soon as practicable so that the Company’s records can be updated. The Company will not be responsible for any inaccurate personal data held on its systems where you have failed to notify it of the relevant change in circumstances.

Kept for longer than is necessary

- The personal data should not be kept in a form which permits identification of a data subject for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is used.

Different categories of personal data will be retained for different periods of time, depending on legal, operational and financial requirements. Any data which the Company decides it does not need to hold for a particular period of time will be destroyed in accordance with its retention of data policy.

Kept confidential and secure

- The personal data must be kept confidential and secure and only processed by authorised personnel.

To achieve this you must follow these steps:

- The Company has in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to data. These procedures must always be adhered to and not overridden or ignored.

- Where the Company provides you with code words or passwords to be used before releasing personal information, for example by telephone, you must strictly follow the Company’s requirements in this regard.

- Only transmit personal information between locations by e-mail if a secure network is in place, for example, encryption is used for e-mail.

- Ensure that any personal data which you hold is kept securely, either in a locked filing cabinet or, if it is computerised, it is password protected so that it is protected from unintended destruction or change and is not seen by unauthorised persons.

- Do not access another employee’s records without authority as this will be treated as gross misconduct and it is also a criminal offence.

- Do not write down (in electronic or hard copy form) opinions or facts concerning a data subject which would be inappropriate to share with that data subject.

- Do not remove personal information from the workplace with the intention of processing it elsewhere unless this is necessary to enable you to carry out your job duties and has been authorised by your line manager.

- Ensure that when working on personal information as part of your job duties when away from your workplace and with the authorisation of your line manager, you continue to observe the terms of this policy and the data protection legislation, in particular in matters of data security.

- Ensure that hard copy personal information is disposed of securely, for example cross-shredded.

- Manual personnel files and data subject files are confidential and are stored [insert details for example in locked filing cabinets]. Only authorised employees have access to these files. For a list of authorised employees, please contact CHOOSE ONE: [insert name of Company’s Data Protection Officer] OR [insert name of Data Representative]. These will not be removed from their normal place of storage without good reason.

- Data stored on memory sticks, discs, portable hard drives or other removable storage media is kept [insert details for example in locked filing cabinets].

- Data held on computers are stored confidentially by means [insert details for example password protection, encryption or coding].

- The Company has network back-up procedures to ensure that data on computers cannot be accidentally lost or destroyed. [More information on the Company’s security policies can be obtained by contacting [insert details]].

Transfer to another country

- Transfer of personal data to countries or organisations outside of the UK should only take place if appropriate safeguarding measures are in place to protect the security of that data.

We do not generally have a need to transfer data outside of the UK. However, if you are requested to transfer personal data to a country or organisation outside of the UK you must not transfer personal data to a country or organisation unless you have in place safeguards to ensure this is done in a legally compliant manner. You must speak to CHOOSE ONE: [the Data Protection Officer] OR [Data Representative] before you send personal data outside of the UK.

The data subject rights

- The data subject must be permitted to exercise their rights in relation to their personal data.

Under the UK GDPR, subject to certain legal limitations, data subjects have available a number of legal rights regarding how their personal data is processed. At any time a data subject can request that the Company should take any of the following actions, subject to certain legal limitations, with regard to their personal data:

- Allow access to the personal data

- Request corrections to be made to data

- Request erasure of data

- Object to the processing of data

- Withdraw their consent if consent was the legal basis for processing

- Request that processing restrictions be put in place

- Request a transfer of personal data

- Object to automated decision making

- Right to be notified of a data security breach

There are different rules and timeframes that apply to each of these rights. You must follow the Company’s policies and procedures whenever you process or receive a request in relation to any of the above rights.

How should you respond to a data subject request?

You must follow the Company’s data subject access procedure which details how to deal with requests and it describes the circumstances where a fee may be charged. The procedure includes the following:

- Always verify the identity of the person making a data subject request and the legitimacy of the request.

- If you are unsure as to whether you are authorised to action the request check the privacy notice to ascertain who is authorised to deal with data subject requests. If you are still unsure how to handle the enquiry, you should forward this to CHOOSE ONE: [the Data Protection Officer] OR [our Data Representative].

- If you are authorised to deal with the request do not give out confidential personal information unless you have received the appropriate consent from the data subject. Seek explicit written consent to process the data subject request and ensure that you keep a clear audit trail of the request and your response.

- Do not share personal information with a third party, unless the data subject has given their explicit prior consent to the sharing of their information. A third party is anyone who is not the actual data subject and can include a family member of the data subject.

- Take great care not to accidentally share information with an unauthorised third party.

Be aware that those seeking information sometimes use deception in order to gain access to it.

Categories of information

During the course of your employment you may be required to process personal data which falls into different categories, general personal data and special categories of personal data. All data should be processed in accordance with the privacy notice and at all times in a confidential manner. However, where that data is classed as a special category extra care should be taken to ensure the privacy and security of that data.

This means that you should maintain a high level of security and you should only share this data with those who are also authorised to process that data. In the context of employee relations the scenarios when you may be required to process special categories information may arise for one or more of the following reasons:

- In order to comply with employment and other laws when processing and managing situations connected with absences arising in relation to sickness or family/dependent-related leave.

- To ensure health and safety obligations and other employment-related obligations are met, you may be required to process information about the physical or mental health or disability status of an employee in order to assess their capability to perform a role. You may also be required to monitor and manage sickness absence, recommend appropriate workplace adjustments and administer health related benefits.

- Where it is needed in the public interest, for example for equal opportunity monitoring and reporting.

- And any other reasons which we advise you of under a separate policy or notice.

We may also require you to process special categories of information in connection with customers and other third parties.

There may also be circumstances where we ask you to process this type of information in relation to assisting the Company with legal claims or to protect a data subject’s interests (or someone else’s).

You may be asked to process information in relation to criminal convictions. This should be processed with the highest degree of confidentiality and in accordance with any data protection legislation and privacy notices that are in force in our business.

If you are unsure about how you should process general personal data or special categories of personal data, you must contact the CHOOSE ONE: [Data Protection Officer] OR [Data Representative].

When will you need to seek consent?

In limited circumstances during your work you may need consent from a data subject in order to process personal data or special categories of data. You will be provided with training and details of which circumstances consent is needed and the type of consent that should be sought.

However, in limited circumstances, you may find it necessary to request a data subject to provide written consent to allow the processing of special categories of personal data. You will be provided with training and details of which circumstances consent is needed and the type of consent that should be sought. For example, in an employment context you should request the data subject’s written consent to instruct a medical practitioner to prepare a medical report. If it becomes necessary to request consent to process special categories of personal data, you must provide the data subject with details of the information that will be required and why it is needed, so that they can make an informed decision as to whether they wish to provide consent.

You must not compel a data subject to provide written consent. Giving consent will always be a decision made by free will and choice and is not a contractual condition. Consent can be withdrawn at any time without any reason provided. You must not subject a data subject to a sanction or detriment as a consequence of withdrawing consent. This would be viewed a serious disciplinary issue.

Exemptions

In limited circumstances there are certain categories of personal data which are exempt from the UK GDPR regime. In an employment context these include:

- Confidential references that are given by the Company to third parties or received by the Company from third parties. Only designated line managers can give Company references. Confidential references will not be provided unless the Company is sure this is the employee’s wish.

- Management forecasts and management planning (including documents setting out management plans for an employee’s future development and progress).

- Data which is required by law to be publicly available.

- Documents subject to legal professional privilege.

Action to be taken in the event of a data protection breach

A personal data breach will arise whenever: 1) any personal data is lost, destroyed, corrupted or disclosed; 2) if someone accesses the data or passes it on without proper authorisation; or 3) if the data is made unavailable and this unavailability has a significant negative effect on a data subject.

In the event of a security incident or breach, do not try to handle this yourself.

You must follow the Company’s Data Breach Policy which includes immediately informing CHOOSE ONE: [the Data Protection Officer] OR [the Data Representative] so that steps can be taken to:

- Contain the breach;

- Assess the potential adverse consequences for individuals, based on how serious or substantial these are, and how likely they are to happen; and

- To limit the scope of the breach by taking steps to mitigate the effects of the breach.

The CHOOSE ONE: [Data Protection Officer] OR [Data Representative] will determine within 72 hours the seriousness of the breach and if the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and/or data subjects need to be notified of the breach.

Record keeping

- [As we have fewer than 250 employees, we only need to document processing activities that:

Training

All employees that handle personal information of individuals must have a basic understanding of the data protection legislation, including the UK GDPR. Staff with duties such as computer and internet security, marketing and database management may need specialist training to make them aware of particular data protection requirements in their work area.

We will provide you with continuous training and updates on how to process personal data in a secure and confidential manner and in accordance with the spirit of the data protection legislation, including the UK GDPR. You will be required to attend all training and to keep yourself informed and aware of any changes made to privacy notices, consent procedures and any other policies and procedures associated with our internal processing of personal data.

You must regularly review all your data processing activities and ensure that you are acting in accordance with the most current best practice and legal obligations in relation to data security and confidentiality.

Automated processing and decision making

From time to time we may use computer programmes to process data and make automated decisions. We will provide you with a separate notice explaining when and how this happens. Where automated processing or decision making does take place and the effect of that processing impacts on the freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject, then in certain circumstances the data subject can request for human intervention. This means that they can ask for a human to review the machine-made outcome/decision.

Sharing personal data

We may share personal data internally as is necessary. You must always ensure that personal data is only shared with authorised persons and is shared in accordance with the purposes stated in any privacy notice or consents. Extra care and security must be taken when sharing special categories of data or transferring data outside of the Company to a third party.

Direct Marketing

We are subject to specific rules under the UK GDPR in relation to marketing our services. Data subjects have the right to reject direct marketing and we must ensure that data subjects are given this option at first point of contact. When a data subject exercises their right to reject marketing you must desist immediately from sending further communications.

Complaints

If you believe that this policy has been breached by a colleague or to exercise all relevant rights, queries or complaints please in the first instance contact our [Data Protection Officer/Data Representative].

Data Protection

As part of your role with Wholegrain,, you’ll come into contact with a lot of important, sensitive and confidential information about our clients, suppliers, business contacts, employees, and anybody else with whom we have a working relationship. Whilst we all know the importance of keeping information that is explicitly stated as “confidential” private, with other types of information it can be less obvious as to how we should treat that information and what safeguards (if any) should be in place to manage it and keep it secure. The various data protection laws that exist in the UK provide that clarification and the contents of this policy come directly from those laws.

It’s essential that you treat any information pertaining to our clients, suppliers, business contacts, employees and anyone else whom we have a working relationship with, with the utmost care and confidentiality. Furthermore, such information, as well as the “personal data” as referred to in the Data Protection Act 1998 and defined below, must be treated in accordance with the rules, requirements and boundaries stipulated within this policy. At the end of this policy is a list of roles and accountabilities that summarise our expectations of all stakeholders of this policy. Anybody found to have violated this policy could be liable for action, up to and including termination of their employment or the cessation of their contract for/of services. It is that serious.

This policy applies to all employees and contractors of Wholegrain. It does not form part of your contract of employment or contract for services and may be amended from time to time. It should be read in conjunction with our ‘Confidentiality Policy’ which references what Wholegrain classifies as confidential information and how it must be managed.

Any, and all, personal data used in conjunction with this policy shall be collected, held, and processed in accordance with this ‘Data Protection Policy.’

This policy should be read in conjunction with the relevant appendices to it:

Appendix 1 (Employee personal data);

Appendix 2 (Contractor personal data)

Definitions

There are a number of important definitions in data protection law that will be referred to in this policy. We’ve included these here at the start so that you have the background info before we dive into the specifics of data protection:

“consent”- this refers to the consent of the “data subject” (see below for definition). Consent in the context of data protection must always be freely given (i.e. not connected with some other action. For example, requested at the same time and part and parcel of signing a new employment contract which might prevent the individual from withdrawing their consent to any provisions within the data protection policy); specific (so that people are clear on what they are consenting to); informed (so that folk know what their entitlement is in relation to their data and the ongoing processing of it); and unambiguous in its indication of the data subjects wishes by which they signify their agreement (or not as the case may be) to the “processing” of “personal data” relating to them.

“data controller”- this refers to the person or organisation which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the “processing” of personal data. For the purpose of this policy, Wholegrain Digital is the “data controller” of all “personal data” relating to employees, contractors, clients, suppliers, and business contacts used within our business for commercial purposes.

“data processor”- refers to the person or organisation who “processes” “personal data” on behalf of Wholegrain. Further details of the current data processors who work with Wholegrain are contained in the relevant appendices to this policy.

“Data Protection Audits”- means an audit to assess how an organisation handles “personal data” and whether it complies with the relevant data protection legislation. A data protection audit helps identify and address any risks or gaps in data protection practices.

“Data Protection Impact Assessment” or “DPIA”- refers to a process undertaken to identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project, especially if the “processing” is likely to result in a high risk to individuals. A DPIA should be undertaken for any project which requires the processing of “personal data.”

“data subject”- refers to a living, identified, or identifiable person about whom the company holds “personal data.” Within Wholegrain, our data subjects are our employees, contractors, suppliers, clients, and anyone else who we work in conjunction with, provide services to or obtain services from.

“personal data”- means any information relating to a data subject who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that data subject. When people think of personal data they often think this is referring to an individual’s name, phone number, address etc… However, personal data covers a range of identifiers including, but not limited to: email address; date of birth; race; gender; religion or belief; credit card numbers; data held by a hospital or doctor; a photograph where an individual is identifiable etc….

“personal data breach”- refers to a breach of security leading to the accidental and/or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise “processed.”

“processing;” “process;” or “processed”- means any operation or set of operations performed on personal data or sets of personal data. This is whether or not that processing is by automated or manual means, and includes the collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction of personal data.

“pseudonymisation”- refers to the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information. For pseudonymisation to exist, that additional information must be kept separately and furthermore is also subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that such personal data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable person.

“special category personal data”- means personal data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, sexual life, sexual orientation, biometric or genetic data. This information is considered particularly sensitive and as such has additional safeguards in place for it to be processed.

Scope

Our policy applies to all team members whether you’re working from home or our offices, as well as subcontractors, suppliers and anybody else that we collaborate with or who acts on our behalf and may require occasional access to the data that we hold, store and process.

This policy relates to the personal data that the company holds, stores and processes relating to identifiable individuals or data subjects that have a connection to Wholegrain in one way or the other.

The Company’s Data Protection Officer is Chris Lewis, Managing Director, who is responsible for administering this policy and for developing and implementing any applicable policies, procedures, and guidelines necessary to support the adherence to this policy by all employees, contractors and other parties working on behalf of Wholegrain. Where applicable, the Data Protection Officer will implement such practices, processes, controls, and training as are reasonably necessary to ensure compliance.

Data Protection Principles

The purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (as amended) is to safeguard any information held by an organisation about an individual and that is classified as either personal or sensitive information or data. This is regardless of whether that data exists electronically, on paper, or on any other materials. The Act states that personal information must be collected and used fairly, stored safely, and not disclosed unlawfully and is underpinned by the following principles that specify that personal data must:

- be processed fairly, lawfully and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject;

- be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. Note that further processing for archiving or statistical purposes is not considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes so long as the data was obtained for valid purposes in the first place and that such was explained clearly to the data subject, and that it is not used in any way that is incompatible with those original purposes;

- be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed;

- be accurate and kept up to date. Every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which it is processed, is erased, or rectified, without delay;

- not be held for any longer than is necessary;

- processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.

The Rights of Data Subjects

Data subjects have the following key rights with respect to their personal data:

1. the right to be informed about the purpose of processing their personal data;

1. the right to have access to their personal data;

1. the right to have their personal data rectified/corrected in the case of errors/out of date information etc;

1. the right to the erasure of their personal data (a.k.a as the right to be forgotten about);

1. the right to restrict the processing of their personal data;

1. the right to data portability, or the transfer of their personal data, without that transfer altering the data or preventing its accessibility;

1. the right to object to their personal data being processed; and

1. rights with respect to automated decision-making (i.e. using machines and algorithms to make decisions based on an individual’s personal data) and profiling in connection with a data subject’s personal data.

Lawful, fair, and transparent processing of data

Data protection laws seek to ensure that personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently, without adversely affecting the rights of the data subject. For the processing of personal data to be lawful, at least one of the following needs to apply:

1. the data subject has given their explicit consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes;

1. the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party to, or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;

1. the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests (i.e. the life) of the data subject or of another individual;

1. the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller; or

1. the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests, and reasonable interests, pursued by the data controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

Processing of “Special Category Personal Data”

If the personal data in question is special category personal data, then at least one of the following conditions must be met:

1. the data subject has given their explicit consent to the processing of such data for one or more specified purposes (unless the law prohibits them from doing so);

1. the processing is necessary for the purpose of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the data controller or of the data subject in the field of employment, social security, and social protection law (insofar as it is authorised by law or a collective agreement pursuant to law which provides for appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject);

1. the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent;

1. the processing relates to personal data which is made public by the data subject;

1. the processing is necessary for the conduct of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity;

1. the processing is necessary for substantial public interest reasons and proportionate to the aim pursued. It must respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject;

1. the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventative or occupational medicine; for the assessment of the working capacity of an employee; for medical diagnosis; for the provision of health or social care or treatment; or the management of health or social care systems or services further to a contract with a health professional and always subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to Article 9 (3) of the UK GDPR (the obligation of professional secrecy);

1. the processing is necessary for public interest reasons in the area of public health which provides for suitable and specifics measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject; or

1. the processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, statistical, or historical research purposes which will be proportional to the aim pursued as well as respect the essence of the right to data protection, and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.

Explicit Consent

If consent is relied upon as the lawful basis for collecting, holding and/or processing personal data, then the following must apply:

- consent is a clear indication by the data subject that they agree to the processing of their personal data. Such a clear indication may take the form of a statement or a positive action. Silence, pre-ticked boxes, or inactivity do not amount to consent;

- where consent is given in a document which includes other matters (for example a contract for services or employment), the section dealing with consent must be kept clearly separate from such other matters so as to not influence those other matters;

- data subjects are free to withdraw consent at any time and it must be made easy for them to do so. Consent that is withdrawn by a data subject must be honoured promptly;

- if personal data is processed for a different purpose that is incompatible with the purpose(s) for which the personal data was originally collected and that was not disclosed to the data subject when they first provided their consent, then consent for the new purpose(s) must be obtained;

- in all cases, where consent is relied upon as the lawful basis for collecting, holding, and/or processing personal data, records must be kept of all consents obtained in order to ensure that Wholegrain can demonstrate its compliance with consent requirements.

Accuracy of data and keeping data up to date

Wholegrain will ensure that all personal data collected, processed, and held by us is kept accurate and up to date. This includes, but is not limited to, the rectification of personal data at the request of a data subject.

The accuracy of personal data will be checked when it is collected and at regular intervals thereafter. If any data is found to be inaccurate or out-of-date, all reasonable steps will be taken without delay to amend or erase that data, as appropriate.

Data retention

Personal data will not be kept for any longer than is necessary in the context of the purpose(s) for which that personal data was originally collected, held, and processed. When personal data is no longer required, all reasonable steps will be taken to erase or otherwise dispose of it without delay. Please refer to the company’s ‘Data Retention Policy’ for further information.

Secure Processing

The company will ensure that all personal data collected, held, and processed is kept secure and protected against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. To achieve this, all technical and organisational measures that are taken to protect personal data will be regularly reviewed and evaluated to ensure their ongoing effectiveness and the continued security of personal data.

Data security will be maintained at all times by protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all personal data as follows:

1. only those with a genuine need to access and use personal data and who are authorised to do so may access and use it;

1. personal data must be accurate and suitable for the purpose(s) for which it is collected, held, and processed; and

1. authorised users must always be able to access the personal data as required for the authorised purpose(s).

Accountability and record-keeping

The company will follow a privacy-by-design approach (i.e. the incorporation of data privacy protections into the design of information systems, products, and services) at all times when collecting, holding, and processing personal data. Data Protection Impact Assessments (a.k.a DPIAs) will be conducted if any processing presents a significant risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects; for any and all new projects; and for new uses of personal data which involve the use of new technologies and where the processing involved is likely to result in a high risk to the right and freedoms of data subjects. DPIA’s will be overseen by the Data Protection officer and will address:

1. the nature, scope, context, and purpose(s) of the collection, holding and processing;

1. the technical and organisational measures to be taken;

1. the type(s) of personal data that will be collected, held, and processed;

1. the purpose(s) for which the personal data is to be used;

1. the company’s objectives and how they are achieved in relation to the personal data to be collected;

1. how the personal data is to be used;

1. the parties (internal and/or external) who are to be consulted about the personal data to be collected;

1. the necessity and proportionality of the data processing with respect to the purpose(s) for which it is being processed and the alternatives that have been considered;

1. the risks posed to data subjects, including their likelihood and severity;

1. the risks posed both within and to the company, including their likelihood and severity;

1. the proposed measures to minimise and handle any identified risks; and

1. the cost of implementing such measures.

In addition, data protection compliance will be regularly reviewed and evaluated by means of Data Protection Audits which will include:

1. the details of any third-party data transfers (including data processors and other data controllers with whom personal data is shared);

1. the purposes for which the company collects, holds, and processes personal data;

1. the legal basis for collecting, holding, and processing personal data;

1. the mechanism(s) for obtaining consent and the records of such consent;

1. details of the categories of personal data collected, held, and processed by the company, and the categories of data subject to which that personal data relates;

1. details of any transfers of personal data to non-UK countries including all mechanisms and security safeguards;

1. details of how long personal data will be retained for;

1. details of personal data storage, including location(s); and

1. detailed descriptions of all technical and organisational measures taken by the company to ensure the security of personal data.

Keeping data subjects informed

Where personal data is collected directly from data subjects, those data subjects must be informed of its purpose at the time of collection.

The company will provide the following information to every data subject at the point of collection:

1. the details of the company including the contact details, names and contact details of any applicable representatives and its Data Protection Officer;

1. the purpose(s) for which the personal data is being collected and will be processed and the lawful basis justifying that collection and processing;

1. where applicable, the legitimate interests upon which the company is justifying its collection and processing of the personal data;

1. where the personal data is not obtained directly from the data subject, the data subject must be advised of the categories of personal data collected and processed as well as the source of that personal data;

1. where the personal data is to be transferred to one or more third parties, the details of those parties must be provided;

1. where the personal data is to be transferred to a third party that is located outside of the UK, the details of that transfer must include, but are not limited to, the safeguards that are in place;

1. the details of applicable retention periods;

1. the details of the data subject’s legal rights under the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 1998;

1. the details of the data subject’s rights to withdraw their consent to the company’s processing of their personal data at any time;

1. the details of the data subject’s right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office;

1. where applicable, the details of any legal or contractual requirement or obligation necessitating the collection and processing of the personal data and the details of any consequences of failing to provide it; and

1. the details of any automated decision-making or profiling that will take place using the personal data, including information on how decisions will be made, the significance of those decisions, and any consequences.

In the event that personal data is obtained from a third-party, those data subjects must be informed of its purpose at the time of collection and that it is to be transferred to another party. This must occur before that transfer is made or as soon as possible afterwards. In any event, the notification cannot occur more than one month after the personal data is obtained.

Data Subject Access

Data subjects may make a subject access request (a.k.a. “SAR”) at any time to find out more about the personal data which the company holds about them, what it is doing with that personal data and why. A SAR request should be submitted to the Data Protection Officer who will normally respond within one month of receipt. If additional time is required in order to respond to the request, the data subject will be advised accordingly.

The company does not charge a fee for the handling of normal SARs however, may impose a fee for additional copies of information and for requests that are manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly where requests are repetitive.

Rectification and erasure of personal data

Data subjects have the right to require the company to rectify any of their personal data that is inaccurate or incomplete. The company will rectify the personal data in question within one month of being informed of the issue. If additional time is required, the data subject will be advised accordingly.

With respect to the erasure of personal data, data subjects have the right to request that the company erases their personal data in the following circumstances:

1. it is no longer necessary for the company to hold that personal data with respect to the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or processed;

1. the data subject wishes to withdraw their consent to the company holding and processing their personal data;

1. the data subject objects to the company holding and processing their personal data and there is no overriding legitimate interest to allow the company to continue doing so;

1. the personal data has been processed unlawfully; or

1. the personal data needs to be erased in order for the company to comply with a particular legal obligation.

Unless the company has reasonable grounds to refuse to erase personal data, all requests for erasure will be complied with within one month of receipt of the data subject’s request. If additional time is required, the data subject will be advised accordingly.

Restriction of personal data processing

Data subjects may request that the company ceases processing the personal data it holds about them. If a data subject makes such a request, the company will retain only the amount of personal data concerning that data subject (if any) that is necessary to ensure that the personal data in question is not processed further. In the event that any affected personal data has been disclosed to third parties, those parties will be informed of the applicable restrictions on processing it unless it is impossible or would require disproportionate effort to do so.

Objections to personal data processing

Data subjects can object to the company processing their personal data based on legitimate interests for direct marketing (including profiling). In such an event, the company will cease processing the data subject’s personal data immediately, unless it can demonstrate that the company’s legitimate grounds for such processing override the data subject’s interests, rights, and freedoms, or that the processing is necessary for the conduct of legal claims.

In the case of direct marketing, where a data subject objects to the company processing their personal data for direct marketing purpose, the company will cease such processing promptly.

Complaints about personal data processing

If you believe that Wholegrain has not complied with your data protection rights, you can complain to the Data Protection Officer via eat@wholegraindigital.com or the Information Commissioner’s Office via www.ico.org.uk.

1. Data will be stored in a range of different places, including in your electronic personnel file, in our HR management systems and in other IT systems (including our email system).

Why Does the Employer Process Personal Data?

1. We need to process your personal data to enter into an employment contract with you and to meet our obligations under your employment contract. For example, we need to process your data to provide you with an employment contract, to pay you in accordance with your employment contract and to administer benefits, pension and insurance entitlements.

1. Where we process other special categories of personal data, such as information about ethnic origin, sexual orientation or religion or belief, this is done for the purposes of carrying out our legal obligations and exercising specific legal rights in relation to employment.

However, if we decide to do so in the future, we will offer you the opportunity to choose (opt out) before your personal data is disclosed to a third party controller (i.e. a non-service provider). Also, if we decide to use your data for purposes that are different from the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorised by you, we will offer you the opportunity to choose (opt out) before such use.

Transfers Outside the United Kingdom and European Economic Area

1. Data which we collect from you may be stored and processed in and transferred to countries outside of the UK and European Economic Area (EEA).
