These four key pillars guide our CSR strategy and ensure that we are not only meeting our obligations but also positively impacting the environment, society, and the communities in which we operate.

Our CSR policy reflects our holistic approach, integrating environmental sustainability, human rights, ethical governance, and active philanthropy into every aspect of our operations. We recognise that businesses today must operate beyond the pursuit of profit, and we are committed to making meaningful contributions to society and the planet. By aligning our CSR efforts with Carroll’s pyramid, we ensure that our business practices are responsible, transparent, and sustainable, paving the way for a better future for all.

# Scope

This CSR policy applies to Green Orbit Digital and its subsidiaries, partners, suppliers, and all stakeholders involved in our operations.

This policy governs all business activities, and we expect all employees, contractors, and partners to adhere to these principles, embracing our shared responsibility for a sustainable future.

Our CSR efforts extend beyond compliance with laws and regulations. We actively promote transparency and accountability at all levels, ensuring that everyone in the Green Orbit Digital ecosystem is aligned with our commitment to sustainable and ethical business practices.

# Policy Elements Based on Carroll’s CSR Pyramid

Green Orbit Digital’s CSR strategy is rooted in Carroll’s CSR Pyramid, with each of the four levels of responsibility (Economic, Legal, Ethical, and Philanthropic) playing a critical role in shaping our approach to CSR. These four dimensions form the foundation of our CSR framework, and our policies and actions align with each level’s core responsibilities.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

1. Economic Responsibilities (Foundation)

At the base of Carroll’s pyramid are economic responsibilities, which form the foundation of any business. For Green Orbit Digital, this means ensuring the financial sustainability of our company while contributing to the broader economy. We are committed to operating in a way that generates long-term value for our shareholders and stakeholders alike.

We avoid exploiting resources, and we commit to delivering value to our customers, employees, and the communities in which we operate. Our profit-generation strategies will always prioritise long-term sustainability over short-term gains.

- Fair market practices: Green Orbit Digital seeks to establish itself as a market leader in sustainability, with a focus on developing solutions that meet the needs of our customers without compromising the environment or social values. Our products and services are designed with consideration for their impact on society and the economy.

By focusing on these economic responsibilities, we ensure that our business operations not only remain profitable but also contribute positively to the economy and society.

By upholding our legal obligations, we demonstrate our commitment to maintaining transparency, honesty, and integrity, ensuring that we act within the law at all times.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

3. Ethical Responsibilities (Expectations)

The ethical level of CSR focuses on doing what is right, even if it is not required by law. These responsibilities go beyond compliance and are often shaped by societal expectations of how a business should operate ethically.

- Commitment to human rights: Green Orbit Digital is dedicated to safeguarding and promoting human rights across our operations. This includes ensuring that our suppliers, partners, and employees are treated with fairness and respect and that their basic human rights are protected. We work diligently to prevent any form of human rights abuse within our value chain.

Philanthropy refers to the voluntary actions businesses can take to improve society, going beyond the minimum requirements of the law and ethics. At Green Orbit Digital, we are committed to using our resources to support social causes, charitable initiatives, and environmental preservation, with the goal of making a positive impact on the world.

- Community engagement and development: We actively engage with and invest in the communities where we operate, helping to drive economic development and improve quality of life. Green Orbit Digital partners with local organisations to sponsor community projects and initiatives that focus on education, social welfare, and sustainable development.
