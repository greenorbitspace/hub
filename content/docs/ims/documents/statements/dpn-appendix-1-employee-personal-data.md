If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis that allows us to do so.

We may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or allowed by law.

9. How do you use special categories of my personal information?

However, we may ask you for your consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If this occurs, you will be made fully aware of the reasons for the processing.

We may only use information relating to criminal convictions where the law allows us to do so. This will usually be where such processing is necessary to carry out our obligations and provided, we do so in line with our data protection policy or other policy that applies to such information.

Very occasionally, we may use information relating to criminal convictions where it is necessary in relation to legal claims, where it is necessary to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public

We do not envisage that we will hold information about criminal convictions.

13. Do you use automated decision-making?

Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses personal information to make a decision without human intervention. We can use automated decision-making in the following circumstances:

- Where we have notified you of the decision and given you 21 days to request a reconsideration;

- Where it is necessary to perform the contract with you and appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights;

- In limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent and where appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights.

If we make an automated decision based on any particularly sensitive personal information, we must have either your explicit written consent or it must be justified in the public interest, and we must also put in place appropriate measures to safeguard your rights.

You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we have notified you.

We do not envisage that any decisions will be taken about you using automated means, however we will notify you in writing if this position changes.

14. Data sharing outside the EU

We may transfer your personal information outside the EU. If we do, you can expect a similar degree of protection in respect of your personal information.
