# Space Sustainability Statement

At Green Orbit Digital, we are dedicated to fostering sustainable practices that ensure the long-term safety, accessibility, and viability of space activities. As the space sector expands, it is imperative that all stakeholders adhere to principles of sustainability to protect Earth’s orbital environment and maintain its benefits for future generations.

Our commitment aligns with the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) Guidelines for the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities (LTS Guidelines). These guidelines provide a comprehensive framework to promote responsible behaviour in outer space, addressing issues such as space debris mitigation, equitable access, and the preservation of orbital environments.

This statement outlines our alignment with the UNOOSA LTS Guidelines and our proactive measures to advance space sustainability.

Our Commitments in Line with the UNOOSA LTS Guidelines

1. Preserving the Space Environment

Guidelines Reference: Section A (Policy and Regulatory Frameworks) and Section D (International Cooperation)

We advocate for and support the adoption of regulatory frameworks that minimise space debris creation, ensuring compliance with guidelines on debris mitigation and end-of-life practices for spacecraft.

We collaborate with stakeholders to encourage active debris removal and the development of technologies that reduce environmental impact in space.

2. Advancing Safety of Space Operations

Guidelines Reference: Section B (Safety of Space Operations)

Promote awareness of best practices for safe and sustainable space operations, including collision avoidance measures and transparency in satellite operations.

Encourage the integration of advanced tracking systems and data sharing to improve situational awareness and reduce risks of collision.

3. Supporting International Collaboration

Guidelines Reference: Section D (International Cooperation, Capacity Building, and Awareness)

Facilitate partnerships between nations, companies, and organisations to strengthen global cooperation in space sustainability.

Advocate for equitable access to space resources and ensure that developing nations are included in discussions and initiatives related to sustainable space activities.

4. Protecting the Orbital Ecosystem

Guidelines Reference: Section C (Scientific and Technical Research and Development)

Promote research and innovation in clean propulsion systems, reusable launch technologies, and sustainable satellite design.

Advocate for transparency in satellite deployments, especially for large constellations, to minimise light pollution and radio frequency interference.

From: Conceptualizing space environmental sustainability

Proposed framework for space sustainability evaluation in reference to the traditional Earth sustainability assessment framework across four domains: (1) pollution, (2) resource depletion, (3) landscape alteration, and (4) space environmental justice, as well as the example indicators under each of these domains in relation to three assessment levels: (1) resource uses and emissions, (2) mid-point, and (3) end-point.
