4. How will you use the information about me?

We will use your personal information only when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal information in the following circumstances:

1. Where we need to comply with a legal obligation. For example, to comply with Health and Safety laws;

1. We may also use your personal information in the following situations, which are likely to be rare:

1. Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests);

1. Where it is needed in the public interest or for official purposes.

5. Situations in which you will use my personal information

We need all the categories of information in the list above (see ‘What data does Wholegrain Digital hold about me?’) primarily to allow us to perform our contract with you and to enable us to comply with legal obligations. In some cases, we may use your personal information for our legitimate interests or those of third parties, provided that your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.

Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds that justify our use of your personal information.

6. Who has access to my personal data?

We may share your personal information with third parties where required by law, where it is necessary to administer the working relationship with you or where we have another legitimate interest in doing so.

Where the company engages third parties to process personal data on its behalf, they do so on the basis of written instructions, are under a duty of confidentiality and are obliged to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of data.

Your data may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) by our third-parties. In the event that a third party will do so on its behalf then the company will ensure that the necessary protocols are in place prior to any transfer occurring.

We may share your personal information with other third parties, for example in the context of the possible sale or restructuring of the business. We may also need to share your personal information with a regulator or to otherwise comply with the law.

7. What happens if I fail to provide my personal information?

If you do not provide certain information when we ask for it, we may not be able to perform the contract that applies to our working relationship with you (such as paying you), or we may not be able to comply with our legal obligations (such as to ensure the health and safety of our workers).

8. Change of purpose

We will only use your personal information for the purposes that we have collected it for, unless we need to use it for another reason and that reason is reasonable and compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis that allows us to do so.

We may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or allowed by law.

9. How do you use special categories of my personal information?

“Special categories” of particularly sensitive personal information require higher levels of protection. We need to have further justification for collecting, storing, and using this type of personal information.

Special categories of include information that relates to the following:

- Health;

- Sex life;

- Sexual orientation;

- Race;

- Ethnic origin;

- Political opinion;

- Religion;

- Trade Union membership; and

- Genetic and biometric data.

We may process special categories of personal information in the situations below:

- In limited circumstances, with your clear written consent;

- Where we need to carry out our legal obligations;

- Where it is required for reasons of substantial public interest;• Where you have already made the data public.

We will use your special categories of personal information in the following ways:

- We will use information about your health and disability status, to ensure your health and safety in the workplace and to provide appropriate workplace adjustments.

- We will use information about your race or national or ethnic origin, religious, philosophical, or moral beliefs, or your sexual life or sexual orientation, to ensure meaningful equal opportunity monitoring and reporting.

We do not need your consent if we use special categories of personal data in order to carry out our legal obligations or exercise specific rights under law. However, we may ask you for your consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If this occurs, you will be made fully aware of the reasons for the processing. As with all cases of seeking consent from you, you will have full control over your decision to give or withhold consent and there will be no consequences where consent is withheld. Consent, once given may be withdrawn at anytime. There will no consequences where consent is withdrawn.

10. What processes to you have in place to ensure the security of my personal data?

Please refer to the ‘Data and IT Security Policy’ for details regarding the measures that Wholegrain Digital have in place to protect the security of your personal data.

11. How long will you keep my personal data for?

The periods of retention of data are set out in the company’s ‘Data Retention Policy.’

12. Do you hold information about criminal convictions?

We may only use information relating to criminal convictions where the law allows us to do so. This will usually be where such processing is necessary to carry out our obligations and provided, we do so in line with our data protection policy or other policy that applies to such information.

Very occasionally, we may use information relating to criminal convictions where it is necessary in relation to legal claims, where it is necessary to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public

We do not envisage that we will hold information about criminal convictions.

13. Do you use automated decision-making?

Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses personal information to make a decision without human intervention. We can use automated decision-making in the following circumstances:

- Where we have notified you of the decision and given you 21 days to request a reconsideration;

- Where it is necessary to perform the contract with you and appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights;

- In limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent and where appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights.

If we make an automated decision based on any particularly sensitive personal information, we must have either your explicit written consent or it must be justified in the public interest, and we must also put in place appropriate measures to safeguard your rights.

You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we have notified you.

We do not envisage that any decisions will be taken about you using automated means, however we will notify you in writing if this position changes.

14. Data sharing outside the EU

We may transfer your personal information outside the EU. If we do, you can expect a similar degree of protection in respect of your personal information.
