# Paris Agreement



# STA/SUS/2025/726-V1.1

At Green Orbit Digital, we recognise the urgent need to address climate change and are fully committed to supporting the goals of the Paris Agreement. This landmark international accord, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to restrict temperature increases to 1.5°C.

We view the space industry as a critical enabler in achieving a sustainable future, and we are dedicated to embedding climate-conscious principles into every aspect of our operations and services.
