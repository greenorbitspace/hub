2.1 – Enable search engine friendly URLs Enable this option in your site settings. If your site doesn't have search engine friendly URLs, talk to your web developer to fix this up.

2.2 - Ensure site navigation is made of real text links – not images If you do not have the main navigation featured in text, your internal pages will almost be invisible to Google and other search engines.

2.3 - Add links to pages you want visible to search engines and visitors on the home page

By placing links on the home page, Google's search engine spider can quickly understand which

pages are important & worth including in the results.

2.4 - Ensure that your chosen keywords are on your page and your page is relevant to the

topic

Simplest approach is to create relevant content around your chosen keywords. Then also make

sure keywords appear naturally in places like the meta tags, h1 tags, image alt tags, etc. Don’t

overdo it!

2.5 - Ensure that you have related phrases in your content along with your main keywords

Use a tool like LSIGraph to find related keywords you can add in your content.

Resource/s

site is built on. If there's none, use a plugin or have your developer fix it. Character limit: 160 for

meta description, 70 for meta title tags.

# 2. On Page SEO

© Adam Clarke / simpleeffectiveness.com

2.10 Add robots.txt in the main directory of the site The robots.txt file is a simple file that exists so you can tell the areas of your site you don’t want Google to list in the search engine results. You may skip this if there are no pages on your site you want excluded from search engines.

2.11 Add canonical tag for duplicates

If you have duplicate content, add a canonical tag to original version so Google determines which

page you want listed in the search results.

As a general rule, include this tag on every page on your site, shortly before the  tag in the

code.

2.12 Check if your site is mobile friendly

Resource/s

https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly

https://www.browserstack.com

Make sure that the site is responsive which means that it automatically resizes across all devices

and has mobile-friendly navigation for mobile users.

As an alternative, you may need to setup a separate mobile subdomain or subfolder for mobile

and tablet users, i.e. m.yoursite.com. Responsive websites are the simplest method.

The above tools make suggestions on how to make your site more mobile friendly. 2.13 User clean code in your site and fix any code errors

By using the Web Standards Validator, you or your developer, can identify code errors, to clean

and fix from your website

Resource/s

https://validator.w3.org/

2.14 Avoid using too much ads

Sites with spammy and aggressive ads are often ranked poorly in search results.

2.15 Fix any 404 errors in your site

By finding them in Google Search Console, click on the error and then click ‘Linked From’ to find

the pages with the broken links.

Resource/s

https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home

2.15 Improve the readability score on your website and make it readable for a wide audience

https://readable.com/

2.16 If you have lots of user created links or ads on your site, tell your developer to add the

following tags on new outgoing links on your site.

You can disregard this if you only have a small site for a small business. And you only need to do

this for new outgoing links, altering these tags is not necessary for old outgoing links on your site.

Official guide from Google published September, 2019, listed below.

rel="sponsored": Use the sponsored attribute to identify links on your site that were created as

part of advertisements

rel="ugc": UGC stands for User Generated Content, and the ugc attribute value is recommended

for links within user generated content

rel="nofollow": Use this attribute for cases where you want to link to a page but don't want to imply any type of endorsement.

2.17 Improve your page experience (fast load speed, fast page responsiveness, and visual

stability while loading)

In November, 2020, Google announced new guides for improving page experience. Improving

page experience can be as simple as loading fast and not having popups bouncing around on

mobile devices.

But for large or complicated sites and performance junkies, send the following official guides to

your web developer, and your technical staff can follow the guidelines and tools provided by

Google.
