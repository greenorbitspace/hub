to run.

1.3 – Upgrade all internal resources and internal links in your HTML

code to use relative URLs

This includes references to HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files, images,

and all other files referenced in your HTML code. This means instead of

referring to internal resources in the website code with an absolute

address (e.g. ‘http://www.yourwebsite.com/logo.jpg’), it should use a

relative address (e.g. ‘./logo.jpg’)

1.4 - Update all of your canonical tags to point to the new HTTPS
