WRAP do not directly work with children or go into schools. However, as part of its schools’ programme

work with schools to develop resources aimed at reception age through to end of primary school, using

practical activities and experiential learning to promote food sustainability and recycling. Elsewhere,

WRAP also works through voluntary organisations such as the Scouts and Girl Guiding movements,

which work with children and young people. WRAP’s aim is to instil child friendly messages about

healthy sustainable eating, preventing food waste and recycling unavoidable food waste. To enable

children to receive these messages WRAP creates resources that can be integrated within existing

school curricula and delivered by teachers. In all work with children’s organisations WRAP observes

the following guidelines:

1. WRAP’s due diligence process ensures that its partners have appropriate safeguarding

arrangements in place.

2. The MOU between WRAP and its partners clarifies their respective roles and responsibilities for

reporting safeguarding concerns.

3. The MOU details how to access WRAP’s safeguarding policy and its safeguarding focal point.

4. WRAP staff are aware of the organisation’s safeguarding policy and reporting procedures and are

provided with the contact details of the safeguarding focal point.

5. WRAP staff have signed the organisation’s Code of Conduct before engaging in work with

children’s organisations.

6. Regarding the use of photographs and videos, WRAP staff are conversant with and committed to

the principles of the organisation’s Consent Form – Photographs, Video and Case Studies. WRAP

staff ensure that consent has been obtained for the taking and use of photographs and videos.

7. Information about WRAP’s complaints procedure is shared with children and with partners.

8. A review of safeguarding work with children’s organisations is conducted annually to identify

lessons learnt to further strengthen WRAPs safeguarding framework.
