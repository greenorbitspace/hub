1. Introduction

At Green Orbit Digital, we are committed to providing a positive work environment where employees feel respected, valued, and supported. However, we recognize that issues or concerns may arise from time to time, and it is important for employees to have a formal mechanism to address grievances. This Grievance Policy outlines the procedure for employees to raise and resolve grievances in a fair, timely, and confidential manner.

2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees of Green Orbit Digital, including full-time, part-time, temporary, and contract employees. It covers grievances related to employment conditions, work environment, interpersonal conflicts, discrimination, harassment, and other work-related issues.

3. Principles

- Fairness: Grievances will be addressed impartially, without bias or favoritism.

- Confidentiality: Information related to grievances will be handled confidentially, with disclosure limited to individuals directly involved in the resolution process.

- Timeliness: Grievances will be addressed promptly and resolved within a reasonable timeframe.

- Respect: Employees raising grievances will be treated with respect and dignity throughout the process.

- No Retaliation: Green Orbit Digital prohibits retaliation against employees who raise grievances in good faith.

4. Informal Resolution

Employees are encouraged to attempt to resolve grievances informally before initiating a formal grievance procedure. This may involve discussing concerns with their immediate supervisor, HR representative, or another trusted colleague. Informal resolution methods may include open communication, mediation, or conflict resolution techniques.

5. Formal Grievance Procedure

If a grievance cannot be resolved informally or if an employee prefers to pursue a formal process, the following steps should be followed:

- Step 1: Submission of Grievance: The employee must submit a written grievance outlining the nature of the grievance, relevant details, and desired outcome, to their immediate supervisor or the HR department. If the grievance involves the immediate supervisor, the employee may bypass this step and submit the grievance directly to HR.

- Step 2: Investigation: Upon receipt of the grievance, HR will initiate an investigation to gather relevant information and evidence. This may involve interviewing the employee raising the grievance, the individual(s) against whom the grievance is raised, and any witnesses. HR will maintain confidentiality throughout the investigation process.

- Step 3: Resolution Meeting: Following the investigation, HR will arrange a meeting with the employee raising the grievance to discuss the findings and potential resolution options. The employee may be accompanied by a colleague or union representative if desired.

- Step 4: Decision and Appeal: HR will communicate the decision regarding the grievance to the employee in writing. If the employee is dissatisfied with the outcome, they may appeal the decision within a specified timeframe (e.g., 7 days). The appeal will be reviewed by a senior manager or an independent panel, and their decision will be final.

6. Records and Documentation

All documentation related to grievances, including written complaints, investigation reports, meeting minutes, and decisions, will be retained in a confidential and secure manner in accordance with data protection laws and retention policies.

7. Training and Awareness

Green Orbit Digital will provide training to managers and HR personnel on handling grievances effectively, including conflict resolution skills, impartiality, confidentiality, and compliance with the grievance policy.

8. Review and Revision

This Grievance Policy will be periodically reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure its effectiveness and compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

9. Contact Information

For questions or assistance regarding grievances, employees should contact the HR department.

This Grievance Policy is effective as of [insert date] and applies to all grievances raised by employees of Green Orbit Digital from this date onwards.





# Grievance Procedure

<!-- Unsupported block type: table -->

Implemented November 2024  | Version 2.0

Statement and Purpose of Policy

1. Green Orbit Digital (the Employer, we, our or us) is committed to dealing with employee grievances fairly, consistently and without unreasonable delay. This policy sets out the way in which an employee should make any complaints they have about work-related matters and the way in which we will deal with these complaints.

1. This is a non-contractual policy and procedure and can be changed by us at any time. If you have any queries about this policy and procedure, contact their line manager or the HR Department

Primary Principles

1. Grievances will be dealt with confidentially so far as is reasonably possible and employees must keep information learnt during this process confidential.

1. The purpose of a grievance or appeal meeting is for the employee to explain their grievance and how they think that it should be resolved using evidence available to make representations, allowing us to come to a decision.Employees will not be subjected to a detriment for raising a grievance in good faith, even if the grievance is not upheld. However, the employee should not use this policy to dispute a disciplinary or dismissal decision. The correct policy for this can be obtained from your line manager the HR Department. Also, if an employee deliberately gives false information, is dishonest or makes a false complaint during the grievance process, this may lead to disciplinary action by us.

1. Employees will not normally be suspended during the grievance process, but we reserve the right to suspend if, at our discretion, we decide that this is helpful and reasonable. For more information on suspensions, see the Employer’s Disciplinary Procedure contained within this Staff Handbook.

1. The employee has the right to appeal any decision made about a grievance as set out in the appeals section of this policy and procedure.

1. The Employer processes personal data collected during informal discussions and the formal grievance procedure in accordance with the Data Protection and Data Security Policy contained within this Staff Handbook. In particular, data collected as part of informal discussions and the grievance procedure is held securely and accessed by, and disclosed to, individuals only for the purposes of responding to the grievance or conducting the grievance procedure. Inappropriate access or disclosure of employee data constitutes a data breach and should be reported in accordance with our Data Protection and Data Security Policy immediately. It may also constitute a disciplinary offence, which will be dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure.

Informal Discussion

1. The Employer promotes communication between employees and so, wherever possible, the employee should try to resolve any grievance at work by firstly talking about it informally with their manager to try and agree on a solution. If the grievance is too serious, or if the employee or we think it is not appropriate in the circumstances to deal with the grievance informally, or if discussing the grievance informally does not work, the employee's grievance will be dealt with formally.

1. If we think that an investigatory interview would be helpful at any stage during the grievance process before a formal meeting is held or continued, we may take statements from the employee or witnesses or review documents at our sole discretion. No decision will be taken until after a grievance hearing has been held. An employee does not normally have the right to bring a companion to an investigative interview. However, we may allow the employee to bring a companion at our absolute discretion.
