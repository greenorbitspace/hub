How to send or request an NDA

- Only team members with signature authority can execute agreements on behalf of GitLab, including Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). 

- The NDA in the standard processes below is pre-signed. For NDAs that require negotiation or third-party templates, follow the non-standard process.

## How To Send an NDA via DocuSign

Team members with DocuSign access can use the pre-signed GitLab NDA template to send an NDA for signature (note: all Sales team members have DocuSign access). A demo of the process can be found here.

1. Log into DocuSign and select Use a Template from the dropdown menu under Start.

1. On the left, select Shared with Me and locate the Non-Disclosure Agreement Pre-Signed Template.

1. Click the template and Add Selected.

1. Under Recipient, enter the signer’s name and email address.

1. Under GitLab Team Member, add anyone else who needs to be cc’d on the signed copy, or click the trash icon to delete this row if not needed.

1. Do not delete or make any changes to the GitLab NDA Tracker fields (this is for the LACA team to track copies of NDAs).

1. Click Send.

Please note: You will be notified by email when the recipient has signed the requested NDA.

- Sales team members: Upload the fully executed copy of the NDA to Salesforce in the customer account.

- Procurement team members: Upload the fully executed NDA to the applicable folder in ContractWorks.
