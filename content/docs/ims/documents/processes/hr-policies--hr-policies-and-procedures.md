## HR considerations

The fast-changing nature of employment law means that it's important to have a comprehensive set of up-to-date HR policies and procedures in place. These can help set out the rights and obligations of those responsible for administering HR and employees.

There are a wide variety of HR policies that can be adopted. A written Health and safety policy is compulsory if you have five or more employees. Other policies can help set out how employment matters such as discipline, employee grievances, parental leave, and issues such as discrimination and equal treatment are dealt with. Having these HR policies incorporated into your business will give your employees clarity and certainty. The prevalence of IT used by employees and the challenges which it brings, such as data protection and the popularity of flexible working, are addressed by other policies.
