Has the company implemented management reviews

and conducts them at least annually?

Do management reviews examine the suitability and

effectiveness of quality systems, improvements needed

due to customer requirements, and resource needs? Do management reviews address audit  ndings,

customer feedback, process performance, corrective

and preventive actions (CAPA), previous management

reviews, QMS changes, improvement recommendations,

and new or revised regulatory requirements?

Has the company implemented a quality manual and

quality assurance procedures and instructions that are

adequate? Has the company established a quality plan? Does quality planning address the needs and quality

objectives of the QMS?

Has the company established a quality policy and quality

objectives?
