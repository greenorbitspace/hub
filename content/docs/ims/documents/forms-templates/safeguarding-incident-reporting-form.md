WRAP is committed to ensuring that every person associated with its work is safeguarded from

harm. This form should be used to report any incident/concern related to WRAP staff, interns, and

trustees.

Whereas we will take every effort to maintain confidentiality, we will take action depending on the

severity of the report or incident. We will always aim to seek consent before acting unless the

obliged to pass the concerns on, in a sensitive manner, to relevant authorities. We will always inform

you of actions taken.

You may wish to submit your concerns anonymously. However please be aware that anonymized
