Consent Form – All media types

To help us raise awareness about our work we capture photographs, audios (voice-overs), videos

and case study information from the people we work with and share them through our media and

communication systems. We share information about our work through our website, through

printed materials, television, fundraising materials, and social media channels. This can inspire

others to support us by raising money, or campaigning with us to impact climate change.

This form allows you to give us your consent to take [photograph, audio, story, or video] or

information about you or your child and your/their situation. If you are not sure about giving

consent or how your information might be used including withdrawing your consent at any time,

please ask our representative or contact us through [insert email].

I hereby waive my right to inspect or approve any copy that is used in connection with the [photograph, audio, story or video] and release and discharge WRAP and the photographer or editor from any and all claims arising out of the use by WRAP and by any other organisation or person to whom WRAP gives permission to use the [photograph, audio, story or video] for the purposes described above, including, but not limited to, any claims for libel and invasion of privacy. I understand that I will not receive compensation for the use of the [photograph, audio, story, or video] in any form.
