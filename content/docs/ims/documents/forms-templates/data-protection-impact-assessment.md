Once you have decided that you require a data protection impact assessment (also known as a Privacy Impact Assessment), you could use the following template to obtain and organise your findings and results. Each step/section is necessary unless otherwise indicated.

Step 1 – Ascertain why it’s needed

Explain:

- what does the project aim to achieve?

- what are the project’s benefits to my company, to individuals and to any other parties?

[Include (optional):

- links to other project related relevant documents e.g. project proposal.]

Summarise

- why it’s needed (link back to screening questions if applicable).

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

Step 2 – Information flows

Describe:

- the collection, use and deletion of personal data.

[Refer to (optional):

- a flow diagram or another way of explaining data flows.]

State:

- how many individuals are likely to be affected by the project.

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

Step 3 – Identify all privacy and related risks

Identify:

- the crucial privacy risks;

- the related compliance and corporate risks.

Use:

- the chart below to assist you with identifying the related compliance risks.

[Note: For high risk processing activities you may wish to record this information on a formal risk register.]

Step 4 - Identify privacy solutions

Describe:

- the actions which you could take to reduce the risks, and any prospective steps which would be required e.g. new guidance or additional security testing

Use:

- the chart below to assist you with identifying the privacy solutions:

Step 6 – Incorporate the assessment outcomes into the project plan

Use:

- the below chart to confirm your findings:

Consultation Requirements

Explain:

- the practical steps you will take to ensure that you identify and address privacy risks;

- who should/will be consulted internally and externally;

- how you will carry out the consultation.

Use:

- the above questions at any stage of the assessment process and link them to different stages where appropriate.

# Sample DPIA template

This template is an example of how you can record your DPIA process and outcome. It follows the process set out in our DPIA guidance, and should be read alongside that guidance and the Criteria for an acceptable DPIA set out in European guidelines on DPIAs.

You should start to fill out the template at the start of any major project involving the use of personal data, or if you are making a significant change to an existing process. The final outcomes should be integrated back into your project plan.

# Step 1: Identify the need for a DPIA

Explain broadly what project aims to achieve and what type of processing it involves. You may find it helpful to refer or link to other documents, such as a project proposal. Summarise why you identified the need for a DPIA.

# Step 2: Describe the processing

Describe the nature of the processing: how will you collect, use, store and delete data? What is the source of the data? Will you be sharing data with anyone? You might find it useful to refer to a flow diagram or other way of describing data flows. What types of processing identified as likely high risk are involved?

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

Describe the scope of the processing: what is the nature of the data, and does it include special category or criminal offence data? How much data will you be collecting and using? How often? How long will you keep it? How many individuals are affected? What geographical area does it cover?

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

Describe the context of the processing: what is the nature of your relationship with the individuals? How much control will they have? Would they expect you to use their data in this way? Do they include children or other vulnerable groups? Are there prior concerns over this type of processing or security flaws? Is it novel in any way? What is the current state of technology in this area? Are there any current issues of public concern that you should factor in? Are you signed up to any approved code of conduct or certification scheme (once any have been approved)?

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

Describe the purposes of the processing: what do you want to achieve? What is the intended effect on individuals? What are the benefits of the processing – for  you, and more broadly?

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

# Step 3: Consultation process

Consider how to consult with relevant stakeholders: describe when and how you will seek individuals’ views – or justify why it’s not appropriate to do so. Who else do you need to involve within your organisation? Do you need to ask your processors to assist? Do you plan to consult information security experts, or any other experts?

# Step 4: Assess necessity and proportionality

Describe compliance and proportionality measures, in particular: what is your lawful basis for processing? Does the processing actually achieve your purpose? Is there another way to achieve the same outcome? How will you prevent function creep? How will you ensure data quality and data minimisation? What information will you give individuals? How will you help to support their rights? What measures do you take to ensure processors comply? How do you safeguard any international transfers?
