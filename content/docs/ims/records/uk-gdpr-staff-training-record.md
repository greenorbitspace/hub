- The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) regularly provides updates to their guidance around the data protection rules. We will update our documents accordingly, so please ensure that you are using the most up-to-date version of our documents.

This is the UK GDPR staff training record of [INSERT BUSINESS NAME].

Background

The UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) includes provisions that promote accountability and governance.

The accountability principle requires businesses and organisations to demonstrate compliance with the principles under the UK GDPR. This may be achieved through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures that ensure and demonstrate that we comply.

The Information Commissioner’s Office states that measures may include internal data protection policies such as staff training, internal audits of processing activities and reviews of internal HR policies.

This is our record of internal staff training in relation to the data protection laws.
