### Business Impact Analysis (BIA) for Green Orbit Digital's Business Continuity Management System (BCMS)

### Introduction

The Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is a critical process within the Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) to ensure that Green Orbit Digital identifies, assesses, and mitigates risks that could impact business operations. It is used to identify key business functions, their dependencies, and the potential impacts of disruption to these functions, ensuring that necessary actions are in place to continue operations in the event of a disruption.
